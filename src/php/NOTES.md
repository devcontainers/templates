### Starting / stopping Apache

This dev container includes Apache in addition to the PHP CLI. While you can use PHP's built in CLI (e.g. `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`), you can start Apache by running:

```bash
apache2ctl start
```

Apache will be available on port `8080`.

If you want to wire in something directly from your source code into the `www` folder, you can add a symlink as follows to `postCreateCommand`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "sudo chmod a+x \"$(pwd)\" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s \"$(pwd)\" /var/www/html"
```

...or execute this from a terminal window once the container is up:

```bash
sudo chmod a+x "$(pwd)" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s "$(pwd)" /var/www/html
```
