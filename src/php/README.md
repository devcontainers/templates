## Options

This template references an image that was [pre-built](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#prebuilding) to automatically include needed devcontainer.json metadata.

* **Image**: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/php ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/php))
* **Applies devcontainer.json contents from image**: Yes ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/blob/main/src/php/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json))

## Starting / stopping Apache

This dev container includes Apache in addition to the PHP CLI. While you can use PHP's built in CLI (e.g. `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`), you can start Apache by running:

```bash
apache2ctl start
```

Apache will be available on port `8080`.

If you want to wire in something directly from your source code into the `www` folder, you can add a symlink as follows to `postCreateCommand`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "sudo chmod a+x \"$(pwd)\" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s \"$(pwd)\" /var/www/html"
```

...or execute this from a terminal window once the container is up:

```bash
sudo chmod a+x "$(pwd)" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s "$(pwd)" /var/www/html
```
