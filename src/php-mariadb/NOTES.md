### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:db
```

### Starting / stopping Apache

This dev container includes Apache in addition to the PHP CLI. While you can use PHP's built in CLI (e.g. `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`), you can start Apache by running:

```bash
apache2ctl start
```

Apache will be available on port `8080`.

If you want to wire in something directly from your source code into the `www` folder, you can add a symlink as follows to `postCreateCommand`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "sudo chmod a+x \"$(pwd)\" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s \"$(pwd)\" /var/www/html"
```

...or execute this from a terminal window once the container is up:

```bash
sudo chmod a+x "$(pwd)" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s "$(pwd)" /var/www/html
```
