# PHP & MariaDB (php-mariadb)

This template references an image that was [pre-built](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#prebuilding) to automatically include needed devcontainer.json metadata.

* **Image**: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/php ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/php))
* **Applies devcontainer.json contents from image**: Yes ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/blob/main/src/php/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json))

## Using this template

This template creates two containers, one for PHP and one for MariaDB. You will be connected to the PHP container, and from within that container the MariabDB container will be available on **`localhost`** port 3305. The MariaDB database has a default password of `mariadb` and you can update MariaDB parameters by updating the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file.

While the template itself works unmodified, it uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/php` image which includes `git`, a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies and Python tools for development.

You can connect to MariaDB from an external tool when connected to the Dev Container from a local tool by updating `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` as follows:

```json
"forwardPorts": [ "3306" ]
```

Once the MariaDB container has port forwarding enabled, it will be accessible from the Host machine at `localhost:3306`. The [MariaDB Documentation](https://mariadb.com/docs/) has:

1. [An Installation Guide for MySQL](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-client/), a CLI tool to work with a MariaDB database.
2. [Tips on populating data](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/how-to-quickly-insert-data-into-mariadb/) in the database. 

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:db
```

### Using the forwardPorts property

By default, web frameworks and tools often only listen to localhost inside the container. As a result, we recommend using the `forwardPorts` property to make these ports available locally.

```json
"forwardPorts": [9000]
```

The `ports` property in `docker-compose.yml` [publishes](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwards the port. This will not work in a cloud environment like Codespaces and applications need to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally. Fortunately the `forwardPorts` property does not have this limitation.

### Starting / stopping Apache

This dev container includes Apache in addition to the PHP CLI. While you can use PHP's built in CLI (e.g. `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`), you can start Apache by running:

```bash
apache2ctl start
```

Apache will be available on port `8080`.

If you want to wire in something directly from your source code into the `www` folder, you can add a symlink as follows to `postCreateCommand`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "sudo chmod a+x \"$(pwd)\" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s \"$(pwd)\" /var/www/html"
```

...or execute this from a terminal window once the container is up:

```bash
sudo chmod a+x "$(pwd)" && sudo rm -rf /var/www/html && sudo ln -s "$(pwd)" /var/www/html
```
