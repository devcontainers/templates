This template references an image that was [pre-built](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#prebuilding) to automatically include needed devcontainer.json metadata.

* **Image**: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/miniconda ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/miniconda))
* **Applies devcontainer.json contents from image**: Yes ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/blob/main/src/miniconda/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json))

## Using this template

This template creates two containers, one for Miniconda and one for PostgreSQL. You will be connected to the Miniconda container, and from within that container the PostgreSQL container will be available on **`localhost`** port 5432. The default database is named `postgres` with a user of `postgres` whose password is `postgres`, and if desired this may be changed in `.devcontainer/.env`. Data is stored in a volume named `postgres-data`.

While the template itself works unmodified, it uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/miniconda` image which includes `git`, a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies and Python tools for development.

You also can connect to PostgreSQL from an external tool when connecting to the Dev Container from a local tool by updating `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` as follows:

```json
"forwardPorts": [ "5432" ]
```

Once the PostgreSQL container has port forwarding enabled, it will be accessible from the Host machine at `localhost:5432`. The [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html) has:

1. [An Installation Guide for PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/installation.html) a CLI tool to work with a PostgreSQL database.
2. [Tips on populating data](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/populate.html) in the database. 

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:[$SERVICE_NAME]
```

### Using Conda
This dev container and its associated miniconda image includes [the `conda` package manager](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/conda/about). Additional packages installed using Conda will be downloaded from Anaconda or another repository if you configure one. To reconfigure Conda in this container to access an alternative repository, please see information on [configuring Conda channels here](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/conda/channel-setup).

Access to the Anaconda repository is covered by the [Anaconda Terms of Service](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/conda/terms), which may require some organizations to obtain a commercial license from Anaconda. **However**, when this dev container or its associated image is used with GitHub Codespaces or GitHub Actions, **all users are permitted** to use the Anaconda Repository through the service, including organizations normally required by Anaconda to obtain a paid license for commercial activities. Note that third-party packages may be licensed by their publishers in ways that impact your intellectual property, and are used at your own risk.

### Using the forwardPorts property

By default, web frameworks and tools often only listen to localhost inside the container. As a result, we recommend using the `forwardPorts` property to make these ports available locally.

```json
"forwardPorts": [9000]
```

The `ports` property in `docker-compose.yml` [publishes](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwards the port. This will not work in a cloud environment like Codespaces and applications need to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally. Fortunately the `forwardPorts` property does not have this limitation.

#### Installing or updating Python utilities

This container installs all Python development utilities using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to avoid impacting the global Python environment. You can use this same utility add additional utilities in an isolated environment. For example:

```bash
pipx install prospector
```

Note that if you change the version of Python from the default, you'll need to run a few commands to update the utilities and `pipx`. More on that next.

#### Installing a different version of Python

As covered in the [user FAQ](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq) for Anaconda, you can install different versions of Python than the one in this image by running the following from a terminal:

```bash
conda install python=3.6
pip install --no-cache-dir pipx
pipx uninstall pipx
pipx reinstall-all
```

Or in a Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
RUN conda install -y python=3.6 \
    && pip install --no-cache-dir pipx \
    && pipx uninstall pipx \
    && pipx reinstall-all
```

See the [pipx documentation](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/docs/) for additional information.

### [Optional] Adding the contents of environment.yml to the image

For convenience, this definition will automatically install dependencies from the `environment.yml` file in the parent folder when the container is built. You can change this behavior by altering this line in the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
RUN if [ -f "/tmp/conda-tmp/environment.yml" ]; then /opt/conda/bin/conda env update -n base -f /tmp/conda-tmp/environment.yml; fi \
    && rm -rf /tmp/conda-tmp
```
