This template references an image that was [pre-built](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#prebuilding) to automatically include needed devcontainer.json metadata.

* **Image**: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/dotnet ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/dotnet))
* **Applies devcontainer.json contents from image**: Yes ([source](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/blob/main/src/dotnet/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json))

## Using this template

This template creates two containers, one for C# (.NET) and one for PostgreSQL. You will be connected to the .NET container, and from within that container the PostgreSQL container will be available on **`localhost`** port 5432. By default, the `postgre` user password is `postgre`. 

Default database parameters may be changed in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file if desired.

You also can connect to PostgreSQL from an external tool when connected to the Dev Container from a local tool by updating `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` as follows:

```json
"forwardPorts": [ "5432" ]
```

Once the PostgreSQL container has port forwarding enabled, it will be accessible from the Host machine at `localhost:5432`. The [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html) has:

1. [An Installation Guide for PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/installation.html) a CLI tool to work with a PostgreSQL database.
2. [Tips on populating data](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/populate.html) in the database. 

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:db
```

### Enabling HTTPS in ASP.NET using your own dev certificate

To enable HTTPS in ASP.NET, you can export a copy of your local dev certificate.

1. Export it using the following command:

    **Windows PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

    **macOS/Linux terminal**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

2. Add the following in to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "remoteEnv": {
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password": "SecurePwdGoesHere",
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path": "${containerEnv:HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx",
    },
    "portsAttributs": {
        "5001": {
            "protocol": "https"
        }
    }
    ```
    ...where `5001` is the HTTPS port.

3. Finally, make the certificate available in the container as follows:

    1. Start the Dev Container
    2. Copy `.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx` from your local home (`/home/yournamehere`) or user profile (`C:\Users\yournamehere`) folder into your Dev Container. For example, you can drag the file into the root of the File Explorer when using VS Code.
    3. Move the file to the correct place in the container. For example, in VS Code start a terminal and run:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p $HOME/.aspnet/https && mv aspnetapp.pfx $HOME/.aspnet/https
        ```

### Using the forwardPorts property

By default, web frameworks and tools often only listen to localhost inside the container. As a result, we recommend using the `forwardPorts` property to make these ports available locally.

```json
"forwardPorts": [9000]
```

The `ports` property in `docker-compose.yml` [publishes](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwards the port. This will not work in a cloud environment like Codespaces and applications need to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally. Fortunately the `forwardPorts` property does not have this limitation.
