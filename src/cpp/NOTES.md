### Using Vcpkg

This dev container and its associated image includes a clone of the [`Vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) repo for library packages, and a bootstrapped instance of the [Vcpkg-tool](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool) itself.

The minimum version of `cmake` required to install packages is higher than the version available in the main package repositories for Debian (<=11) and Ubuntu (<=21.10).  `Vcpkg` will download a compatible version of `cmake` for its own use if that is the case (on x86_64 architectures), however you can opt to reinstall a different version of `cmake` globally by replacing `${templateOption:reinstallCmakeVersionFromSource}` with version (say 3.21.5) in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`. 

Most additional library packages installed using Vcpkg will be downloaded from their [official distribution locations](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#security). To configure Vcpkg in this container to access an alternate registry, more information can be found here: [Registries: Bring your own libraries to vcpkg](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/registries-bring-your-own-libraries-to-vcpkg/).

To update the available library packages, pull the latest from the git repository using the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cd "${VCPKG_ROOT}"
git pull --ff-only
```

> Note: Please review the [Vcpkg license details](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#license) to better understand its own license and additional license information pertaining to library packages and supported ports.
