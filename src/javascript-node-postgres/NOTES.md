## Description

This definition creates two containers, one for Node.js and one for PostgreSQL. VS Code will attach to the Node.js container, and from within that container the PostgreSQL container will be available on **`localhost`** port 5432. The default database is named `postgres` with a user of `postgres` whose password is `postgres`, and if desired this may be changed in `docker-compose.yml`. Data is stored in a volume named `postgres-data`.

While the definition itself works unmodified, it uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node` image which includes `git`, `eslint`, `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development.

You also can connect to PostgreSQL from an external tool when using VS Code by updating `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` as follows:

```json
"forwardPorts": [ "5432" ]
```

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentaiton](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:db
```
