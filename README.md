<strong>Development Container Templates</strong><br />
A simple set of dev container 'templates' to help get you up and running with a containerized environment.
</td>

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. It allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment which can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing.

This repository contains a set of **Dev Container Templates** which are source files packaged together that encode configuration for a complete development environment. A Template can be used in a new or existing project, and a [supporting tool](https://containers.dev/supporting) will use the configuration from the template to build a development container.

## Contents
 
-   [`src`](src) - A collection of subfolders, each declaring a template. Each subfolder contains at least a
    `devcontainer-template.json` and a [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/).
-   [`test`](test) - Mirroring `src`, a folder-per-template with at least a `test.sh` script. These tests are executed by the [CI](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-pr.yaml).

## Contributions

### Creating your own collection of templates

The [Dev Container Template specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/templates-distribution/#distribution) outlines a pattern for community members and organizations to self-author Templates in repositories they control.

A starter repository [devcontainers/template-starter](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter) and [GitHub Action](https://github.com/devcontainers/action) are available to help bootstrap self-authored Templates.

We are eager to hear your feedback on self-authoring!  Please provide comments and feedback on [spec issue #71](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues/71).

### Contributing to this repository

This repository will accept improvement and bug fix contributions related to the
[current set of maintained templates](./src).

## Feedback

Issues related to these templates can be reported in [an issue](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/issues) in this repository.

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en) :sparkles:. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="./assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

 <img src="./assets/images/contribution_cta.png" width="300" height="150" /> 

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. For more information, see [the development guide](contributing/development.md).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [GitHubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en). 

Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can [contribute to the docs](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could possibly cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

The github.dev web-based editor is a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. You can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes.


There are two ways to go directly to a VS Code environment in your browser and start coding:


* Press the . key on any repository or pull request.

* Swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL. For example, this repo https://github.com/github/dev becomes http://github.dev/github/dev


Preview the gif below to get a quick demo of github.dev in action.


![github dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/856858/130119109-4769f2d7-9027-4bc4-a38c-10f297499e8f.gif)


# Why?

It’s a quick way to edit and navigate code. It's especially useful if you want to edit multiple files at a time or take advantage of all the powerful code editing features of Visual Studio Code when making a quick change. For more information, see our [documentation](https://github.co/codespaces-editor-help).

# Telegram iOS Source Code Compilation Guide

We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.

# Creating your Telegram Application

1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.

# Compilation Guide

1. Install Xcode (directly from https://developer.apple.com/download/more or using the App Store).
2. Clone the project from GitHub:

```
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS.git
```

3. Adjust configuration parameters

```
mkdir -p $HOME/telegram-configuration
cp -R build-system/example-configuration/* $HOME/telegram-configuration/
```

- Modify the values in `variables.bzl`
- Replace the provisioning profiles in `provisioning` with valid files

4. (Optional) Create a build cache directory to speed up rebuilds

```
mkdir -p "$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache"
```

5. Build the app

```
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
    build \
    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
    --buildNumber=100001 \
    --configuration=release_universal
```

6. (Optional) Generate an Xcode project

```
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
    generateProject \
    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
    --disableExtensions
```

It is possible to generate a project that does not require any codesigning certificates to be installed: add `--disableProvisioningProfiles` flag:
```
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
    generateProject \
    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
    --disableExtensions \
    --disableProvisioningProfiles
```


Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.


# Tips

Bazel is used to build the app. To simplify the development setup a helper script is provided (`build-system/Make/Make.py`). See help:

```
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --help
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py build --help
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py generateProject --help
```

Bazel is automatically downloaded when running Make.py for the first time. If you wish to use your own build of Bazel, pass `--bazel=path-to-bazel`. If your Bazel version differs from that in `versions.json`, you may use `--overrideBazelVersion` to skip the version check.

Each release is built using specific Xcode and Bazel versions (see `versions.json`). The helper script checks the versions of installed software and reports an error if they don't match the ones specified in `versions.json`. There are flags that allow to bypass these checks:

```
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideBazelVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Bazel
python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideXcodeVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Xcode
```
