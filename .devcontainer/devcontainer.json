const { files } = await Deno.emit("./mod.ts", {

Setting check to false will instruct Deno to not utilise the TypeScript compiler to type check the code and emit it, instead only transpiling the code from within Deno. This can be significantly quicker than doing the full type checking.

Compiler options
Deno.emit() supports quite a few compiler options that can impact how code is type checked and emitted. They are similar to the options supported by a tsconfig.json in the compilerOptions section, but there are several options that are not supported. This is because they are either meaningless in Deno or would cause Deno to not be able to work properly. The defaults for Deno.emit("const { files } = await Deno.emit("./mod.ts", {

## Development

Instructions on how to build from source can be found
[here](./contributing/building_from_source.md).

## Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting, please make sure the following is done:

1. Give the PR a descriptive title.

Examples of good PR title:

- fix(std/http): Fix race condition in server
- docs(console): Update docstrings
- feat(doc): Handle nested re-exports

Examples of bad PR title:

- fix #7123
- update docs
- fix bugs

2. Ensure there is a related issue and it is referenced in the PR text.
3. Ensure there are tests that cover the changes.
4. Ensure `cargo test` passes.
5. Ensure `./tools/format.js` passes without changing files.
6. Ensure `./tools/lint.js` passes.

## Adding Ops (aka bindings)

We are very concerned about making mistakes when adding new APIs. When adding an
Op to Deno, the counterpart interfaces on other platforms should be researched.
Please list how this functionality is done in Go, Node, Rust, and Python.

As an example, see how `Deno.rename()` was proposed and added in
[PR #671](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/671).

## Releases

Summary of the changes from previous releases can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases).

## Documenting APIs

It is important to document public APIs and we want to do that inline with the
code. This helps ensure that code and documentation are tightly coupled
together.

### Utilize JSDoc

All publicly exposed APIs and types, both via the `deno` module as well as the
global/`window` namespace should have JSDoc documentation. This documentation is
parsed and available to the TypeScript compiler, and therefore easy to provide
further downstream. JSDoc blocks come just prior to the statement they apply to
and are denoted by a leading `/**` before terminating with a `*/`. For example:

```ts
/** A simple JSDoc comment */
export const FOO = "foo";
```

#### Resources

Resources (AKA `rid`) are Deno's version of file descriptors. They are integer
values used to refer to open files, sockets, and other concepts. For testing it
would be good to be able to query the system for how many open resources there
are.

```ts
console.log(Deno.resources());
// { 0: "stdin", 1: "stdout", 2: "stderr" }
Deno.close(0);
console.log(Deno.resources());
// { 1: "stdout", 2: "stderr" }
```

#### Metrics

Metrics is Deno's internal counter for various statistics.

```shell
> console.table(Deno.metrics())
┌─────────────────────────┬───────────┐
│          (idx)          │  Values   │

## Building from source

Below are instructions on how to build Deno from source. If you just want to use
Deno you can download a prebuilt executable (more information in the
`Getting Started` chapter).

### Cloning the Repository

Clone on Linux or Mac:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/denoland/deno.git
```

Extra steps for Windows users:

1. [Enable "Developer Mode"](https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+enable+developer+mode)
   (otherwise symlinks would require administrator privileges).
2. Make sure you are using git version 2.19.2.windows.1 or newer.
3. Set `core.symlinks=true` before the checkout:
   ```shell
   git config --global core.symlinks true
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/denoland/deno.git
   ```

### Prerequisites

> Deno requires the progressively latest stable release of Rust. Deno does not
> support the Rust nightlies.
[Update or Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Check that
Rust installed/updated correctly:

```
rustc -V
cargo -V
```

### Building Deno

The easiest way to build Deno is by using a precompiled version of V8:

```
cargo build -vv
```

However if you want to build Deno and V8 from source code:

```
V8_FROM_SOURCE=1 cargo build -vv
```

When building V8 from source, there are more dependencies:

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) for running WPT tests. Ensure that
a suffix-less `python`/`python.exe` exists in your `PATH` and it refers to
Python 3.

For Linux users glib-2.0 development files must also be installed. (On Ubuntu,
run `apt install libglib2.0-dev`.)

Mac users must have Command Line Tools installed.
([XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) already includes CLT. Run
`xcode-select --install` to install it without XCode.)

For Windows users:

1. Get [VS Community 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with
   "Desktop development with C++" toolkit and make sure to select the following
   required tools listed below along with all C++ tools.

   - Visual C++ tools for CMake
   - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)
   - Testing tools core features - Build Tools
   - Visual C++ ATL for x86 and x64
   - Visual C++ MFC for x86 and x64
   - C++/CLI support
   - VC++ 2015.3 v14.00 (v140) toolset for desktop

2. Enable "Debugging Tools for Windows". Go to "Control Panel" → "Programs" →
   "Programs and Features" → Select "Windows Software Development Kit - Windows
   10" → "Change" → "Change" → Check "Debugging Tools For Windows" → "Change" →
   "Finish". Or use:
   [Debugging Tools for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/)
   (Notice: it will download the files, you should install
   `X64 Debuggers And Tools-x64_en-us.msi` file manually.)

See [rusty_v8's README](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) for more details
about the V8 build.

### Building

Build with Cargo:

```shell
# Build:
cargo build -vv
# Build errors?  Ensure you have latest main and try building again, or if that doesn't work try:
cargo clean && cargo build -vv
# Run:
./target/debug/deno run cli/tests/002_hello.ts
```

## Testing and Tools

### Tests

Test `deno`:

```shell
# Run the whole suite:
cargo test
# Only test cli/tests/unit/:
cargo test js_unit_tests
```

Test `std/`:

```shell
cargo test std_tests
```

### Lint and format

Lint the code:

```shell
deno run -A --unstable ./tools/lint.js
```

Format the code:

```shell
deno run -A --unstable ./tools/format.js
```

### Continuous Benchmarks

See our benchmarks [over here](https://deno.land/benchmarks)

The benchmark chart supposes
https://github.com/denoland/benchmark_data/blob/gh-pages/data.json has the type
`BenchmarkData[]` where `BenchmarkData` is defined like the below:

```ts
interface ExecTimeData {
  mean: number;
  stddev: number;
  user: number;
  system: number;
  min: number;
  max: number;
}
interface BenchmarkData {
  created_at: string;
  sha1: string;
  benchmark: {
    [key: string]: ExecTimeData;
  };
  binarySizeData: {
    [key: string]: number;
  };
  threadCountData: {
    [key: string]: number;
  };
  syscallCountData: {
    [key: string]: number;
  };
}

### Profiling

### Perf profiling:

Tools that can be used to generate/ visualise perf results:

- flamegraph-rs (https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph)
- flamescope (https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope)

Example using perf on `micro_bench_ops` and visualising using flamescope:

```sh
# build `examples/micro_bench_ops`
cargo build --release --example micro_bench_ops
# run `examples/micro_bench_ops` using perf
sudo perf record -F 49 -a -g -- ./target/release/examples/micro_bench_ops
sudo perf script --header > micro_bench_ops_perf
# now open the file using flamescope
```

Example running `deno_tcp.ts` in combination with flamegraph (`script.sh`):

```sh
sudo flamegraph -o flamegraph.svg target/debug/deno run --allow-net cli/bench/deno_tcp.ts &
sleep 1
./third_party/prebuilt/linux64/wrk http://localhost:4500/
sleep 1
kill `pgrep perf`
```

### v8 profiling:

Example using v8 profiling on `micro_bench_ops`:

```sh
# build `examples/micro_bench_ops`
cargo build --release --example micro_bench_ops
# run `examples/micro_bench_ops`
./target/release/examples/micro_bench_ops --prof
```

Example using v8 profiling on `deno_tcp.ts`:

```sh
# build `deno`
cargo build --release
# run `deno_tcp.ts`
./target/release/deno --v8-flags=--prof --allow-net cli/bench/deno_tcp.ts &
sleep 1
./third_party/prebuilt/linux64/wrk http://localhost:4500/
sleep 1
kill `pgrep deno`
```

V8 will write a file in the current directory that looks like this:
`isolate-0x7fad98242400-v8.log`. To examine this file:

```sh
node --prof-process isolate-0x7fad98242400-v8.log > prof.log
```

`prof.log` will contain information about tick distribution of different calls.

To view the log with Web UI, generate JSON file of the log:

Open `rusty_v8/v8/tools/profview/index.html` in your browser, and select
`prof.json` to view the distribution graphically.

Useful V8 flags during profiling:

- --prof
- --log-internal-timer-events
- --log-timer-events
- --track-gc
- --log-source-code
- --track-gc-object-stats

To learn more about profiling, check out the following links:

- [https://v8.dev/docs/profile](https://v8.dev/docs/profile)

### Debugging with LLDB

To debug the deno binary, we can use `rust-lldb`. It should come with `rustc`
and is a wrapper around LLDB.

```shell
$ rust-lldb -- ./target/debug/deno run --allow-net tests/http_bench.ts
# On macOS, you might get warnings like
# `ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref`
# In that case, use system python by setting PATH, e.g.
# PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:$PATH
(lldb) command script import "/Users/kevinqian/.rustup/toolchains/1.36.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/etc/lldb_rust_formatters.py"
(lldb) type summary add --no-value --python-function lldb_rust_formatters.print_val -x ".*" --category Rust
(lldb) type category enable Rust
(lldb) target create "../deno/target/debug/deno"
Current executable set to '../deno/target/debug/deno' (x86_64).
(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args  "tests/http_bench.ts" "--allow-net"
(lldb) b op_start
(lldb) r
```

### V8 flags

V8 has many many internal command-line flags:

```shell
$ deno run --v8-flags=--help _
SSE3=1 SSSE3=1 SSE4_1=1 SSE4_2=1 SAHF=1 AVX=1 FMA3=1 BMI1=1 BMI2=1 LZCNT=1 POPCNT=1 ATOM=0

# Linking to third party code

In the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) section, we saw Deno could
execute scripts from URLs. Like browser JavaScript, Deno can import libraries
directly from URLs. This example uses a URL to import an assertion library:

**test.ts**

```ts
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";
assertEquals("hello", "hello");
assertEquals("world", "world");
console.log("Asserted! ✓");
```

Try running this:

```shell
$ deno run test.ts
Compile file:///mnt/f9/Projects/github.com/denoland/deno/docs/test.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fmt/colors.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/diff.ts
Asserted! ✓
```

Note that we did not have to provide the `--allow-net` flag for this program,
and yet it accessed the network. The runtime has special access to download
imports and cache them to disk.

Deno caches remote imports in a special directory specified by the `DENO_DIR`
environment variable. It defaults to the system's cache directory if `DENO_DIR`
is not specified. The next time you run the program, no downloads will be made.
If the program hasn't changed, it won't be recompiled either. The default
directory is:

- On Linux/Redox: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/deno` or `$HOME/.cache/deno`
- On Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/deno` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` = `FOLDERID_LocalAppData`)
- On macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/deno`
- If something fails, it falls back to `$HOME/.deno`

## FAQ

### How do I import a specific version of a module?

Specify the version in the URL. For example, this URL fully specifies the code
being run: `https://unpkg.com/liltest@0.0.5/dist/liltest.js`.

### It seems unwieldy to import URLs everywhere.

> What if one of the URLs links to a subtly different version of a library?
> Isn't it error prone to maintain URLs everywhere in a large project?
The solution is to import and re-export your external libraries in a central
`deps.ts` file (which serves the same purpose as Node's `package.json` file).
For example, let's say you were using the above assertion library across a large
project. Rather than importing
`"https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts"` everywhere, you could
create a `deps.ts` file that exports the third-party code:

**deps.ts**

```ts
export {
  assert,
  assertEquals,
  assertStrContains,
} from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";
```

And throughout the same project, you can import from the `deps.ts` and avoid
having many references to the same URL:

```ts
import { assertEquals, runTests, test } from "./deps.ts";
```

This design circumvents a plethora of complexity spawned by package management
software, centralized code repositories, and superfluous file formats.

### How can I trust a URL that may change?

By using a lock file (with the `--lock` command line flag), you can ensure that
the code pulled from a URL is the same as it was during initial development. You
can learn more about this
[here](./linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking.md).

### But what if the host of the URL goes down? The source won't be available.

This, like the above, is a problem faced by _any_ remote dependency system.
Relying on external servers is convenient for development but brittle in
production. Production software should always vendor its dependencies. In Node
this is done by checking `node_modules` into source control. In Deno this is
done by pointing `$DENO_DIR` to some project-local directory at runtime, and
similarly checking that into source control:

```shell
# Download the dependencies.
DENO_DIR=./deno_dir deno cache src/deps.ts
# Make sure the variable is set for any command which invokes the cache.
DENO_DIR=./deno_dir deno test src
# Check the directory into source control.
git add -u deno_dir
git commit
```

## Import maps

Deno supports [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps).

You can use import maps with the `--import-map=<FILE>` CLI flag.

Example:

**import_map.json**

```js
{
   "imports": {
      "fmt/": "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fmt/"
   }
}
```

**color.ts**

```ts
import { red } from "fmt/colors.ts";
console.log(red("hello world"));
```

Then:

```shell
$ deno run --import-map=import_map.json color.ts
```

To use your project root for absolute imports:

**import_map.json**

```jsonc
{
  "imports": {
    "/": "./",
    "./": "./"
  }
}
```

**main.ts**

```ts
import { MyUtil } from "/util.ts";
```

This causes import specifiers starting with `/` to be resolved relative to the
import map's URL or file path.

## Integrity checking & lock files

### Introduction

Let's say your module depends on remote module `https://some.url/a.ts`. When you
compile your module for the first time `a.ts` is retrieved, compiled and cached.
It will remain this way until you run your module on a new machine (say in
production) or reload the cache (through `deno cache --reload` for example). But
what happens if the content in the remote url `https://some.url/a.ts` is
changed? This could lead to your production module running with different
dependency code than your local module. Deno's solution to avoid this is to use
integrity checking and lock files.

### Caching and lock files

Deno can store and check subresource integrity for modules using a small JSON
file. Use the `--lock=lock.json` to enable and specify lock file checking. To
update or create a lock use `--lock=lock.json --lock-write`. The
`--lock=lock.json` tells Deno what the lock file to use is, while the
`--lock-write` is used to output dependency hashes to the lock file
(`--lock-write` must be used in conjunction with `--lock`).

A `lock.json` might look like this, storing a hash of the file against the
dependency:

```json
{
  "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/textproto/mod.ts": "3118d7a42c03c242c5a49c2ad91c8396110e14acca1324e7aaefd31a999b71a4",
  "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/io/util.ts": "ae133d310a0fdcf298cea7bc09a599c49acb616d34e148e263bcb02976f80dee",
  "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/async/delay.ts": "35957d585a6e3dd87706858fb1d6b551cb278271b03f52c5a2cb70e65e00c26a",
   ...
}
```

A typical workflow will look like this:

**src/deps.ts**

```ts
// Add a new dependency to "src/deps.ts", used somewhere else.
export { xyz } from "https://unpkg.com/xyz-lib@v0.9.0/lib.ts";
```

Then:

```shell
# Create/update the lock file "lock.json".
deno cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/deps.ts
# Include it when committing to source control.
git add -u lock.json
git commit -m "feat: Add support for xyz using xyz-lib"
git push
```

Collaborator on another machine -- in a freshly cloned project tree:

```shell
# Download the project's dependencies into the machine's cache, integrity
# checking each resource.
deno cache --reload --lock=lock.json src/deps.ts
# Done! You can proceed safely.
deno test --allow-read src
```

### Runtime verification

Like caching above, you can also use the `--lock=lock.json` option during use of
the `deno run` sub command, validating the integrity of any locked modules
during the run. Remember that this only validates against dependencies
previously added to the `lock.json` file. New dependencies will be cached but
not validated.

You can take this a step further as well by using the `--cached-only` flag to
require that remote dependencies are already cached.

```shell
deno run --lock=lock.json --cached-only mod.ts
```

This will fail if there are any dependencies in the dependency tree for mod.ts
which are not yet cached.

## Private modules and repositories

There maybe instances where you want to load a remote module that is located in
a _private_ repository, like a private repository on GitHub.

Deno supports sending bearer tokens when requesting a remote module. Bearer
tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0 and is
broadly supported by hosting services (e.g. GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket,
Cloudsmith, etc.).

### DENO_AUTH_TOKENS

The Deno CLI will look for an environment variable named `DENO_AUTH_TOKENS` to
determine what authentication tokens it should consider using when requesting
remote modules. The value of the environment variable is in the format of a _n_
number of tokens deliminated by a semi-colon (`;`) where each token is in the
format of `{token}@{hostname[:port]}`.

For example a single token for would look something like this:

```sh
DENO_AUTH_TOKENS=a1b2c3d4e5f6@deno.land
```

And multiple tokens would look like this:

```sh
DENO_AUTH_TOKENS=a1b2c3d4e5f6@deno.land;f1e2d3c4b5a6@example.com:8080
```

When Deno goes to fetch a remote module, where the hostname matches the hostname
of the remote module, Deno will set the `Authorization` header of the request to
the value of `Bearer {token}`. This allows the remote server to recognize that
the request is an authorized request tied to a specific authenticated user, and
provide access to the appropriate resources and modules on the server.

### GitHub

To be able to access private repositories on GitHub, you would need to issue
yourself a _personal access token_. You do this by logging into GitHub and going
under _Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens_:

![Personal access tokens settings on GitHub](../images/private-pat.png)

You would then choose to _Generate new token_ and give your token a description
and appropriate access:

![Creating a new personal access token on GitHub](../images/private-github-new-token.png)

And once created GitHub will display the new token a single time, the value of
which you would want to use in the environment variable:

![Display of newly created token on GitHub](../images/private-github-token-display.png)

In order to access modules that are contained in a private repository on GitHub,
you would want to use the generated token in the `DENO_AUTH_TOKENS` environment
variable scoped to the `raw.githubusercontent.com` hostname. For example:

```sh
DENO_AUTH_TOKENS=a1b2c3d4e5f6@raw.githubusercontent.com
```

This should allow Deno to access any modules that the user who the token was
issued for has access to.

When the token is incorrect, or the user does not have access to the module,
GitHub will issue a `404 Not Found` status, instead of an unauthorized status.
So if you are getting errors that the modules you are trying to access are not
found on the command line, check the environment variable settings and the
personal access token settings.

In addition, `deno run -L debug` should print out a debug message about the
number of tokens that are parsed out of the environment variable. It will print
an error message if it feels any of the tokens are malformed. It won't print any
details about the tokens for security purposes.

## Proxies

Deno supports proxies for module downloads and the Web standard `fetch` API.

Proxy configuration is read from environmental variables: `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`.

In case of Windows, if environment variables are not found Deno falls back to
reading proxies from registry.

## Reloading modules

By default, a module in the cache will be reused without fetching or
re-compiling it. Sometimes this is not desirable and you can force deno to
refetch and recompile modules into the cache. You can invalidate your local
`DENO_DIR` cache using the `--reload` flag of the `deno cache` subcommand. It's
usage is described below:

### To reload everything

```bash
deno cache --reload my_module.ts
```

### To reload specific modules

Sometimes we want to upgrade only some modules. You can control it by passing an
argument to a `--reload` flag.

To reload all \$STD_VERSION standard modules:

```bash
deno cache --reload=https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION my_module.ts
```

To reload specific modules (in this example - colors and file system copy) use a
comma to separate URLs.

```bash
deno cache --reload=https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/copy.ts,https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fmt/colors.ts my_module.ts
```

# Using npm/Node.js code

While Deno is pretty powerful itself, there is a large eco-system of code in the
[npm](https://npmjs.com/) registry, and many people will want to re-leverage
tools, code and libraries that are built for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). In
this chapter we will explore how to use it.

The good news, is that in many cases, it _just works_.

There are some foundational things to understand about differences between
Node.js and Deno that can help in understanding what challenges might be faced:

- Current Node.js supports both CommonJS and ES Modules, while Deno only
  supports ES Modules. The addition of stabilized ES Modules in Node.js is
  relatively recent and most code written for Node.js is in the CommonJS format.
- Node.js has quite a few built-in modules that can be imported and they are a
  fairly expansive set of APIs. On the other hand, Deno focuses on implementing
  web standards and where functionality goes beyond the browser, we locate APIs
  in a single global `Deno` variable/namespace. Lots of code written for Node.js
  expects/depends upon these built-in APIs to be available.
- Node.js has a non-standards based module resolution algorithm, where you can
  import bare-specifiers (e.g. `react` or `lodash`) and Node.js will look in
  your local and global `node_modules` for a path, introspect the `package.json`
  and try to see if there is a module named the right way. Deno resolves modules
  the same way a browser does. For local files, Deno expects a full module name,
  including the extension. When dealing with remote imports, Deno expects the
  web server to do any "resolving" and provide back the media type of the code
  (see the
  [Determining the type of file](../typescript/overview.md#determining-the-type-of-file)
  for more information).
- Node.js effectively doesn't work without a `package.json` file. Deno doesn't
  require an external meta-data file to function or resolve modules.
- Node.js doesn't support remote HTTP imports. It expects all 3rd party code to
  be installed locally on your machine using a package manager like `npm` into
  the local or global `node_modules` folder. Deno supports remote HTTP imports
  (as well as `data` and `blob` URLs) and will go ahead and fetch the remote
  code and cache it locally, similar to the way a browser works.

In order to help mitigate these differences, we will further explore in this
chapter:

- Using the [`std/node`](./npm_nodejs/std_node.md) modules of the Deno standard
  library to "polyfill" the built-in modules of Node.js
- Using [CDNs](./npm_nodejs/cdns.md) to access the vast majority of npm packages
  in ways that work under Deno.
- How [import maps](./npm_nodejs/import_maps.md) can be used to provide "bare
  specifier" imports like Node.js under Deno, without needing to use a package
  manager to install packages locally.
- And finally, a general section of
  [frequently asked questions](./npm_nodejs/faqs.md)

That being said, there are some differences that cannot be overcome:

- Node.js has a plugin system that is incompatible with Deno, and Deno will
  never support Node.js plugins. If the Node.js code you want to use requires a
  "native" Node.js plugin, it won't work under Deno.
- Node.js has some built in modules (e.g. like `vm`) that are effectively
  incompatible with the scope of Deno and therefore there aren't easy ways to
  provide a _polyfill_ of the functionality in Deno.

## Packages from CDNs

Because Deno supports remote HTTP modules, and content delivery networks (CDNs)
can be powerful tools to transform code, the combination allows an easy way to
access code in the npm registry via Deno, usually in a way that works with Deno
without any further actions, and often enriched with TypeScript types. In this
section we will explore that in detail.

### What about `deno.land/x/`?

The [`deno.land/x/`](https://deno.land/x/) is a public registry for code,
hopefully code written specifically for Deno. It is a public registry though and
all it does is "redirect" Deno to the location where the code exists. It doesn't
transform the code in any way. There is a lot of great code on the registry, but
at the same time, there is some code that just isn't well maintained (or doesn't
work at all). If you are familiar with the npm registry, you know that as well,
there are varying degrees of quality.

Because it simply serves up the original published source code, it doesn't
really help when trying to use code that didn't specifically consider Deno when
authored.

### Deno "friendly" CDNs

Deno friendly content delivery networks (CDNs) not only host packages from npm,
they provide them in a way that maximizes their integration to Deno. They
directly address some of the challenges in consuming code written for Node.js:

- The provide packages and modules in the ES Module format, irrespective of how
  they are published on npm.
- They resolve all the dependencies as the modules are served, meaning that all
  the Node.js specific module resolution logic is handled by the CDN.
- Often, they inform Deno of type definitions for a package, meaning that Deno
  can use them to type check your code and provide a better development
  experience.
- The CDNs also "polyfill" the built-in Node.js modules, making a lot of code
  that leverages the built-in Node.js modules _just work_.
- The CDNs deal with all the semver matching for packages that a package manager
  like `npm` would be required for a Node.js application, meaning you as a
  developer can express your 3rd party dependency versioning as part of the URL
  you use to import the package.

#### esm.sh

[esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) is a CDN that was specifically designed for Deno,
though addressing the concerns for Deno also makes it a general purpose CDN for
accessing npm packages as ES Module bundles. esm.sh uses
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to take an arbitrary npm package and
ensure that it is consumable as an ES Module. In many cases you can just import
the npm package into your Deno application:

```ts
import React from "https://esm.sh/react";
export default class A extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
}
```

esm.sh supports the use of both specific versions of packages, as well as
[semver](https://semver.npmjs.com/) versions of packages, so you can express
your dependency in a similar way you would in a `package.json` file when you
import it. For example, to get a specific version of a package:

```ts
import React from "https://esm.sh/react@17.0.2";
```

Or to get the latest patch release of a minor release:

```ts
import React from "https://esm.sh/react@~16.13.0";
```

esm.sh uses the `std/node` polyfills to replace the built-in modules in Node.js,
meaning that code that uses those built-in modules will have the same
limitations and caveats as those modules in `std/node`.

esm.sh also automatically sets a header which Deno recognizes that allows Deno
to be able to retrieve type definitions for the package/module. See
[Using `X-TypeScript-Types` header](../typescript/types.md#using-x-typescript-types-header)
in this manual for more details on how this works.

The CDN is also a good choice for people who develop in mainland China, as the
hosting of the CDN is specifically designed to work with "the great firewall of
China", as well as esm.sh provides information on self hosting the CDN as well.

Check out the [esm.sh homepage](https://esm.sh/) for more detailed information
on how the CDN can be used and what features it has.

#### Skypack

[Skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/) is designed to make development overall
easier by not requiring packages to be installed locally, even for Node.js
development, and to make it easy to create web and Deno applications that
leverage code from the npm registry.

Skypack has a great way of discovering packages in the npm registry, by
providing a lot of contextual information about the package, as well as a
"scoring" system to try to help determine if the package follows best-practices.

Skypack detects Deno's user agent when requests for modules are received and
ensures the code served up is tailored to meet the needs of Deno. The easiest
way to load a package is to use the
[lookup URL](https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/api-reference/lookup-urls) for
the package:

```ts
import React from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/react";
export default class A extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
}
```

Lookup URLs can also contain the [semver](https://semver.npmjs.com/) version in
the URL:

```ts
import React from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@~16.13.0";
```

By default, Skypack does not set the types header on packages. In order to have
the types header set, which is automatically recognized by Deno, you have to
append `?dts` to the URL for that package:

```ts
import { pathToRegexp } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/path-to-regexp?dts";
const re = pathToRegexp("/path/:id");
```

See
[Using `X-TypeScript-Types` header](../typescript/types.md#using-x-typescript-types-header)
in this manual for more details on how this works.

Skypack docs have a
[specific page on usage with Deno](https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/code/deno)
for more information.

### Other CDNs

There are a couple of other CDNs worth mentioning.

#### UNPKG

[UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) is the most well known CDN for npm packages. For
packages that include an ES Module distribution for things like the browsers,
many of them can be used directly off of UNPKG. That being said, everything
available on UNPKG is available on more Deno friendly CDNs.

#### JSPM

The [jspm.io](https://jspm.io) CDN is specifically designed to provide npm and
other registry packages as ES Modules in a way that works well with import maps.
While it doesn't currently cater to Deno, the fact that Deno can utilize import
maps, allows you to use the [JSPM.io generator](https://generator.jspm.io/) to
generate an import-map of all the packages you want to use and have them served
up from the CDN.

### Considerations

While CDNs can make it easy to allow Deno to consume packages and modules from
the npm registry, there can still be some things to consider:

- Deno does not (and will not) support Node.js plugins. If the package requires
  a native plugin, it won't work under Deno.
- Dependency management can always be a bit of a challenge and a CDN can make it
  a bit more obfuscated what dependencies are there. You can always use
  `deno info` with the module or URL to get a full breakdown of how Deno
  resolves all the code.
- While the Deno friendly CDNs try their best to serve up types with the code
  for consumption with Deno, lots of types for packages conflict with other
  packages and/or don't consider Deno, which means you can often get strange
  diagnostic message when type checking code imported from these CDNs, though
  skipping type checking will result in the code working perfectly fine. This is
  a fairly complex topic and is covered in the
  [Types and type declarations](../typescript/types.md) section of the manual.

## Frequently asked questions

### Getting errors when type checking like `cannot find namespace NodeJS`

One of the modules you are using has type definitions that depend upon the
NodeJS global namespace, but those types don't include the NodeJS global
namespace in their types.

The quickest fix is to skip type checking. You can do this by using the
`--no-check` flag.

Skipping type checking might not be acceptable though. You could try to load the
Node.js types yourself. For example from UNPKG it would look something like
this:

```ts
import type {} from "https://unpkg.com/@types/node/index.d.ts";
```

Or from esm.sh:

```ts
import type {} from "https://esm.sh/@types/node/index.d.ts";
```

Or from Skypack:

```ts
import type {} from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@types/node/index.d.ts";
```

You could also try to provide only specifically what the 3rd party package is
missing. For example the package `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` has a dependency on
the `NodeJS.ProcessEnv` type in its type definitions. In one of the modules of
your project that imports it as a dependency, you could put something like this
in there which will solve the problem:

```ts
declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    type ProcessEnv = Record<string, string>;
  }
}
```

### Getting type errors like cannot find `document` or `HTMLElement`

The library you are using has dependencies on the DOM. This is common for
packages that are designed to run in a browser as well as server-side. By
default, Deno only includes the libraries that are directly supported. Assuming
the package properly identifies what environment it is running in at runtime it
is "safe" to use the DOM libraries to type check the code. For more information
on this, check out the
[Targeting Deno and the Browser](../typescript/configuration.md#targeting-deno-and-the-browser)
section of the manual.

## Using import maps

Deno supports [import maps](../linking_to_external_code/import_maps.md) which
allow you to supply Deno with information about how to resolve modules that
overrides the default behavior. Import maps are a web platform standard that is
increasingly being included natively in browsers. They are specifically useful
with adapting Node.js code to work well with Deno, as you can use import maps to
map "bare" specifiers to a specific module.

When coupled with Deno friendly [CDNs](./cdns.md) import maps can be a powerful
tool in managing code and dependencies without need of a package management
tool.

### Bare and extension-less specifiers

Deno will only load a fully qualified module, including the extension. The
import specifier needs to either be relative or absolute. Specifiers that are
neither relative or absolute are often called "bare" specifiers. For example
`"./lodash/index.js"` is a relative specifier and
`https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash` is an absolute specifier. Where is `"lodash"`
would be a bare specifier.

Also Deno requires that for local modules, the module to load is fully
resolve-able. When an extension is not present, Deno would have to "guess" what
the author intended to be loaded. For example does `"./lodash"` mean
`./lodash.js`, `./lodash.ts`, `./lodash.tsx`, `./lodash.jsx`,
`./lodash/index.js`, `./lodash/index.ts`, `./lodash/index.jsx`, or
`./lodash/index.tsx`?

When dealing with remote modules, Deno allows the CDN/web server define whatever
semantics around resolution the server wants to define. It just treats a URL,
including its query string, as a "unique" module that can be loaded. It expects
the CDN/web server to provide it with a valid media/content type to instruct
Deno how to handle the file. More information on how media types impact how Deno
handles modules can be found in the
[Determining the type of file](../typescript/overview.md#determining-the-type-of-file)
section of the manual.

Node.js does have defined semantics for resolving specifiers, but they are
complex, assume unfettered access to the local file system to query it. Deno has
chosen not to go down that path.

But, import maps can be used to provide some of the ease of the developer
experience if you wish to use bare specifiers. For example, if we want to do the
following in our code:

```ts
import lodash from "lodash";
```

We can accomplish this using an import map, and we don't even have to install
the `lodash` package locally. We would want to create a JSON file (for example
**import_map.json**) with the following:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "lodash": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash"
  }
}
```

And we would run our program like:

```
> deno run --import-map ./import_map.json example.ts
```

If you wanted to manage the versions in the import map, you could do this as
well. For example if you were using Skypack CDN, you can used a
[pinned URL](https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/api-reference/pinned-urls-optimized)
for the dependency in your import map. For example, to pin to lodash version
4.17.21 (and minified production ready version), you would do this:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "lodash": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/pin/lodash@v4.17.21-K6GEbP02mWFnLA45zAmi/mode=imports,min/optimized/lodash.js"
  }
}
```

### Overriding imports

The other situation where import maps can be very useful is the situation where
you have tried your best to make something work, but have failed. For example
you are using an npm package which has a dependency on some code that just
doesn't work under Deno, and you want to substitute another module that
"polyfills" the incompatible APIs.

For example, let's say we have a package that is using a version of the built in
`"fs"` module that we have a local module we want to replace it with when it
tries to import it, but we want other code we are loading to use the standard
library replacement module for `"fs"`. We would want to create an import map
that looked something like this:

```ts
{
  "imports": {
    "fs": "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/node/fs.ts"
  },
  "scopes": {
    "https://deno.land/x/example": {
      "fs": "./patched/fs.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

Import maps can be very powerful, check out the official
[standards README](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#the-import-map) for more
information.

## The `std/node` library

The `std/node` part of the Deno standard library is a Node.js compatibility
layer. It's primary focus is providing "polyfills" for Node.js's
[built-in modules](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/tree/main/node#supported-builtins).
It also provides a mechanism for loading CommonJS modules into Deno.

The library is most useful when trying to use your own or private code that was
written for Node.js. If you are trying to consume public npm packages, you are
likely to get a better result using a [CDN](./cdns.md).

### Node.js built-in modules

The standard library provides several "replacement" modules for Node.js built-in
modules. These either replicate the functionality of the built-in or they call
the Deno native APIs, returning an interface that is compatible with Node.js.

The standard library provides modules for the the following built-ins:

- [`assert`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/assert.ts)
  (_partly_)
- [`buffer`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/buffer.ts)
- [`child_process`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/child_process.ts)
  (_partly_)
- [`console`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/console.ts)
  (_partly_)
- [`constants`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/constants.ts)
  (_partly_)
- [`crypto`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/crypto.ts)
  (_partly_)
- [`events`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/events.ts)
- [`fs`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/fs.ts) (_partly_)
- [`module`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/module.ts)
- [`os`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/os.ts) (_partly_)
- [`path`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/path.ts)
- [`process`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/process.ts)
  (_partly_)
- [`querystring`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/querystring.ts)
- [`stream`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/stream.ts)
- [`string_decoder`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/string_decoder.ts)
- [`timers`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/timers.ts)
- [`tty`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/tty.ts) (_partly_)
- [`url`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/url.ts)
- [`util`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/util.ts) (_partly_)

In addition, there is the
[`std/node/global.ts`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/node/global.ts)
module which provides some of the Node.js globals like `global`, `process`, and
`Buffer`.

If you want documentation for any of the modules, you can simply type `deno doc`
and the URL of the module in your terminal:

```
> deno doc https://deno.land/std/assert.ts
```

### Loading CommonJS modules

Deno only supports natively loading ES Modules, but a lot of Node.js code is
still written in the CommonJS format. As mentioned above, for public npm
packages, it is often better to use a CDN to transpile CommonJS modules to ES
Modules for consumption by Deno. Not only do you get reliable conversion plus
all the dependency resolution and management without requiring a package manager
to install the packages on your local machine, you get the advantages of being
able to share your code easier without requiring other users to setup some of
the Node.js infrastructure to consume your code with Node.js.

That being said, the built-in Node.js module `"module"` provides a function
named `createRequire()` which allows you to create a Node.js compatible
`require()` function which can be used to load CommonJS modules, as well as use
the same resolution logic that Node.js uses when trying to load a module.
`createRequire()` will also install the Node.js globals for you.

Example usage would look like this:

```ts
import { createRequire } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/node/module.ts";
// import.meta.url will be the location of "this" module (like `__filename` in
// Node.js), and then serve as the root for your "package", where the
// `package.json` is expected to be, and where the `node_modules` will be used
// for resolution of packages.
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
// Loads the built-in module Deno "replacement":
const path = require("path");
// Loads a CommonJS module (without specifying the extension):
const cjsModule = require("./my_mod");
// Uses Node.js resolution in `node_modules` to load the package/module. The
// package would need to be installed locally via a package management tool
// like npm:
const leftPad = require("left-pad");
```

When modules are loaded via the created `require()`, they are executed in a
context which is similar to a Node.js context, which means that a lot of code
written targeting Node.js will work.

# Runtime

Documentation for all runtime functions (Web APIs + `Deno` global) can be found
on [`doc.deno.land`](https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable).

## Web Platform APIs

For APIs where a web standard already exists, like `fetch` for HTTP requests,
Deno uses these rather than inventing a new proprietary API.

For more details, view the chapter on
[Web Platform APIs](./runtime/web_platform_apis.md).

## `Deno` global

All APIs that are not web standard are contained in the global `Deno` namespace.
It has the APIs for reading from files, opening TCP sockets, serving HTTP, and
executing subprocesses, etc.

The TypeScript definitions for the Deno namespaces can be found in the
[`lib.deno.ns.d.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/$CLI_VERSION/cli/dts/lib.deno.ns.d.ts)
file.

The documentation for all of the Deno specific APIs can be found on

## HTTP Server APIs

As of Deno 1.9 and later, _native_ HTTP server APIs were introduced which allow
users to create robust and performant web servers in Deno.

The API tries to leverage as much of the web standards as is possible as well as
tries to be simple and straight forward.

> ℹ️ The APIs are currently unstable, meaning they can change in the future in
> breaking ways and should be carefully considered before using in production
> code. They require the `--unstable` flag to make them available.
### Listening for a connection

In order to accept requests, first you need to listen for a connection on a
network port. To do this in Deno, you use `Deno.listen()`:

```ts
const server = Deno.listen({ port: 8080 });
```

> ℹ️ When supplying a port, Deno assumes you are going to listen on a TCP socket
> as well as bind to the localhost. You can specify `transport: "tcp"` to be
> more explicit as well as provide an IP address or hostname in the `hostname`
> property as well.
If there is an issue with opening the network port, `Deno.listen()` will throw,
so often in a server sense, you will want to wrap it in the `try ... catch`
block in order to handle exceptions, like the port already being in use.

You can also listen for a TLS connection (e.g. HTTPS) using `Deno.listenTls()`:

```ts
const server = Deno.listenTls({
  port: 8443,
  certFile: "localhost.crt",
  keyFile: "localhost.key",
  alpnProtocols: ["h2", "http/1.1"],
});
```

The `certFile` and `keyFile` options are required and point to the appropriate
certificate and key files for the server. They are relative to the CWD for Deno.
The `alpnProtocols` property is optional, but if you want to be able to support
HTTP/2 on the server, you add the protocols here, as the protocol negotiation
happens during the TLS negotiation with the client and server.

> ℹ️ Generating SSL certificates is outside of the scope of this documentation.
> There are many resources on the web which address this.
### Handling connections

Once we are listening for a connection, we need to handle the connection. The
return value of `Deno.listen()` or `Deno.listenTls()` is a `Deno.Listener` which
is an async iterable which yields up `Deno.Conn` connections as well as provide
a couple methods for handling connections.

To use it as an async iterable we would do something like this:

```ts
const server = Deno.listen({ port: 8080 });
for await (const conn of server) {
  // ...handle the connection...
}
```

Every connection made would yielded up a `Deno.Conn` assigned to `conn`. Then
further processing can be applied to the connection.

There is also the `.accept()` method on the listener which can be used:

```ts
const server = Deno.listen({ port: 8080 });
while (true) {
  try {
    const conn = await server.accept();
    // ... handle the connection ...
  } catch (err) {
    // The listener has closed
    break;
  }
}
```

Whether using the async iterator or the `.accept()` method, exceptions can be
thrown and robust production code should handle these using `try ... catch`
blocks. Especially when it comes to accepting TLS connections, there can be many
conditions, like invalid or unknown certificates which can be surfaced on the
listener and might need handling in the user code.

A listener also has a `.close()` method which can be used to close the listener.

### Serving HTTP

Once a connection is accepted, you can use `Deno.serveHttp()` to handle HTTP
requests and responses on the connection. `Deno.serveHttp()` returns a
`Deno.HttpConn`. A `Deno.HttpConn` is like a `Deno.Listener` in that requests
the connection receives from the client are asynchronously yielded up as a
`Deno.RequestEvent`.

To deal with HTTP requests as async iterable it would look something like this:

```ts
const server = Deno.listen({ port: 8080 });
for await (const conn of server) {
  (async () => {
    const httpConn = Deno.serveHttp(conn);
    for await (const requestEvent of httpConn) {
      // ... handle requestEvent ...
    }
  })();
}
```

The `Deno.HttpConn` also has the method `.nextRequest()` which can be used to
await the next request. It would look something like this:

```ts
const server = Deno.listen({ port: 8080 });
while (true) {
  try {
    const conn = await server.accept();
    (async () => {
      const httpConn = Deno.serveHttp(conn);
      while (true) {
        try {
          const requestEvent = await httpConn.nextRequest();
          // ... handle requestEvent ...
        } catch (err) {
          // the connection has finished
          break;
        }
      }
    })();
  } catch (err) {
    // The listener has closed
    break;
  }
}
```

Note that in both cases we are using an IIFE to create an inner function to deal
with each connection. If we awaited the HTTP requests in the same function scope
as the one we were receiving the connections, we would be blocking accepting
additional connections, which would make it seem that our server was "frozen".
In practice, it might make more sense to have a separate function all together:

```ts
async function handle(conn: Deno.Conn) {
  const httpConn = Deno.serveHttp(conn);
  for await (const requestEvent of httpConn) {
    // ... handle requestEvent
  }
}
const server = Deno.listen({ port: 8080 });
for await (const conn of server) {
  handle(conn);
}
```

In the examples from this point on, we will focus on what would occur within an
example `handle()` function and remove the listening and connection
"boilerplate".

### HTTP Requests and Responses

HTTP requests and responses in Deno are essentially the inverse of web standard
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). The
Deno HTTP Server API and the Fetch API leverage the
[`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object
classes. So if you are familiar with the Fetch API you just need to flip them
around in your mind and now it is a server API.

As mentioned above, a `Deno.HttpConn` asynchronously yields up
`Deno.RequestEvent`s. These request events contain a `.request` property and a
`.respondWith()` method.

The `.request` property is an instance of the `Request` class with the
information about the request. For example, if we wanted to know what URL path
was being requested, we would do something like this:

```ts
async function handle(conn: Deno.Conn) {
  const httpConn = Deno.serveHttp(conn);
  for await (const requestEvent of httpConn) {
    const url = new URL(requestEvent.request.url);
    console.log(`path: ${url.path}`);
  }
}
```

The `.respondWith()` method is how we complete a request. The method takes
either a `Response` object or a `Promise` which resolves with a `Response`
object. Responding with a basic "hello world" would look like this:

```ts
async function handle(conn: Deno.Conn) {
  const httpConn = Deno.serveHttp(conn);
  for await (const requestEvent of httpConn) {
    await requestEvent.respondWith(
      new Response("hello world", {
        status: 200,
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

Note that we awaited the `.respondWith()` method. It isn't required, but in
practice any errors in processing the response will cause the promise returned
from the method to be rejected, like if the client disconnected before all the
response could be sent. While there may not be anything your application needs
to do, not handling the rejection will cause an "unhandled rejection" to occur
which will terminate the Deno process, which isn't so good for a server. In
addition, you might want to await the promise returned in order to determine
when to do any cleanup from for the request/response cycle.

The web standard `Response` object is pretty powerful, allowing easy creation of
complex and rich responses to a client, and Deno strives to provide a `Response`
object that as closely matches the web standard as possible, so if you are
wondering how to send a particular response, checkout out the documentation for
the web standard
[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

### HTTP/2 Support

HTTP/2 support is effectively transparent within the Deno runtime. Typically
HTTP/2 is negotiated between a client and a server during the TLS connection
setup via
[ALPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation). To
enable this, you need to provide the protocols you want to support when you
start listening via the `alpnProtocols` property. This will enable the
negotiation to occur when the connection is made. For example:

```ts
const server = Deno.listenTls({
  port: 8443,
  certFile: "localhost.crt",
  keyFile: "localhost.key",
  alpnProtocols: ["h2", "http/1.1"],
});
```

The protocols are provided in order of preference. In practice, the only two
protocols that are supported currently are HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 which are
expressed as `h2` and `http/1.1`.

Currently Deno does not support upgrading a plain-text HTTP/1.1 connection to an
HTTP/2 cleartext connection via the `Upgrade` header (see:
[#10275](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/10275)), so therefore HTTP/2
support is only available via a TLS/HTTPS connection.

@@ -1,76 +0,0 @@
## Location API

Deno supports the
[`location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location)
global from the web. Please read on.

### Location flag

There is no "web page" whose URL we can use for a location in a Deno process. We
instead allow users to emulate a document location by specifying one on the CLI
using the `--location` flag. It can be a `http` or `https` URL.

```ts
// deno run --location https://example.com/path main.ts
console.log(location.href);
// "https://example.com/path"
```

You must pass `--location <href>` for this to work. If you don't, any access to
the `location` global will throw an error.

```ts
// deno run main.ts
console.log(location.href);
// error: Uncaught ReferenceError: Access to "location", run again with --location <href>.
```

Setting `location` or any of its fields will normally cause navigation in
browsers. This is not applicable in Deno, so it will throw in this situation.

```ts
// deno run --location https://example.com/path main.ts
location.pathname = "./foo";
// error: Uncaught NotSupportedError: Cannot set "location.pathname".
```

### Extended usage

On the web, resource resolution (excluding modules) typically uses the value of
`location.href` as the root on which to base any relative URLs. This affects
some web APIs adopted by Deno.

#### Fetch API

```ts
// deno run --location https://api.github.com/ --allow-net main.ts
const response = await fetch("./orgs/denoland");
// Fetches "https://api.github.com/orgs/denoland".
```

The `fetch()` call above would throw if the `--location` flag was not passed,
since there is no web-analogous location to base it onto.

#### Worker modules

```ts
// deno run --location https://example.com/index.html --allow-net main.ts
const worker = new Worker("./workers/hello.ts", { type: "module" });
// Fetches worker module at "https://example.com/workers/hello.ts".
```

### Only use if necessary

For the above use cases, it is preferable to pass URLs in full rather than
relying on `--location`. You can manually base a relative URL using the `URL`
constructor if needed.

The `--location` flag is intended for those who have some specific purpose in
mind for emulating a document location and are aware that this will only work at
application-level. However, you may also use it to silence errors from a
dependency which is frivolously accessing the `location` global.

## Permission APIs

Permissions are granted from the CLI when running the `deno` command. User code
will often assume its own set of required permissions, but there is no guarantee
during execution that the set of _granted_ permissions will align with this.

In some cases, ensuring a fault-tolerant program requires a way to interact with
the permission system at runtime.

### Permission descriptors

On the CLI, read permission for `/foo/bar` is represented as
`--allow-read=/foo/bar`. In runtime JS, it is represented as the following:

```ts
const desc = { name: "read", path: "/foo/bar" } as const;
```

Other examples:

```ts
// Global write permission.
const desc1 = { name: "write" } as const;
// Write permission to `$PWD/foo/bar`.
const desc2 = { name: "write", path: "foo/bar" } as const;
// Global net permission.
const desc3 = { name: "net" } as const;
// Net permission to 127.0.0.1:8000.
const desc4 = { name: "net", host: "127.0.0.1:8000" } as const;
// High-resolution time permission.
const desc5 = { name: "hrtime" } as const;
```

### Query permissions

Check, by descriptor, if a permission is granted or not.

```ts
// deno run --allow-read=/foo main.ts
const desc1 = { name: "read", path: "/foo" } as const;
console.log(await Deno.permissions.query(desc1));
// PermissionStatus { state: "granted" }
const desc2 = { name: "read", path: "/foo/bar" } as const;
console.log(await Deno.permissions.query(desc2));
// PermissionStatus { state: "granted" }
const desc3 = { name: "read", path: "/bar" } as const;
console.log(await Deno.permissions.query(desc3));
// PermissionStatus { state: "prompt" }
```

### Permission states

A permission state can be either "granted", "prompt" or "denied". Permissions
which have been granted from the CLI will query to `{ state: "granted" }`. Those
which have not been granted query to `{ state: "prompt" }` by default, while
`{ state: "denied" }` reserved for those which have been explicitly refused.
This will come up in [Request permissions](#request-permissions).

### Permission strength

The intuitive understanding behind the result of the second query in
[Query permissions](#query-permissions) is that read access was granted to
`/foo` and `/foo/bar` is within `/foo` so `/foo/bar` is allowed to be read.

We can also say that `desc1` is
_[stronger than](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/#ref-for-permissiondescriptor-stronger-than)_
`desc2`. This means that for any set of CLI-granted permissions:

1. If `desc1` queries to `{ state: "granted" }` then so must `desc2`.
2. If `desc2` queries to `{ state: "denied" }` then so must `desc1`.

More examples:

```ts
const desc1 = { name: "write" } as const;
// is stronger than
const desc2 = { name: "write", path: "/foo" } as const;
const desc3 = { name: "net", host: "127.0.0.1" } as const;
// is stronger than
const desc4 = { name: "net", host: "127.0.0.1:8000" } as const;
```

### Request permissions

Request an ungranted permission from the user via CLI prompt.

```ts
// deno run main.ts
const desc1 = { name: "read", path: "/foo" } as const;
const status1 = await Deno.permissions.request(desc1);
// ⚠️ Deno requests read access to "/foo". Grant? [g/d (g = grant, d = deny)] g
console.log(status1);
// PermissionStatus { state: "granted" }
const desc2 = { name: "read", path: "/bar" } as const;
const status2 = await Deno.permissions.request(desc2);
// ⚠️ Deno requests read access to "/bar". Grant? [g/d (g = grant, d = deny)] d
console.log(status2);
// PermissionStatus { state: "denied" }
```

If the current permission state is "prompt", a prompt will appear on the user's
terminal asking them if they would like to grant the request. The request for
`desc1` was granted so its new status is returned and execution will continue as
if `--allow-read=/foo` was specified on the CLI. The request for `desc2` was
denied so its permission state is downgraded from "prompt" to "denied".

If the current permission state is already either "granted" or "denied", the
request will behave like a query and just return the current status. This
prevents prompts both for already granted permissions and previously denied
requests.

### Revoke permissions

Downgrade a permission from "granted" to "prompt".

```ts
// deno run --allow-read=/foo main.ts
const desc = { name: "read", path: "/foo" } as const;
console.log(await Deno.permissions.revoke(desc));
// PermissionStatus { state: "prompt" }
```

However, what happens when you try to revoke a permission which is _partial_ to
one granted on the CLI?

```ts
// deno run --allow-read=/foo main.ts
const desc = { name: "read", path: "/foo/bar" } as const;
console.log(await Deno.permissions.revoke(desc));
// PermissionStatus { state: "granted" }
```

It was not revoked.

To understand this behaviour, imagine that Deno stores an internal set of
_explicitly granted permission descriptors_. Specifying `--allow-read=/foo,/bar`
on the CLI initializes this set to:

```ts
[
  { name: "read", path: "/foo" },
  { name: "read", path: "/bar" },
];
```

Granting a runtime request for `{ name: "write", path: "/foo" }` updates the set
to:

```ts
[
  { name: "read", path: "/foo" },
  { name: "read", path: "/bar" },
  { name: "write", path: "/foo" },
];
```

Deno's permission revocation algorithm works by removing every element from this
set which the argument permission descriptor is _stronger than_. So to ensure
`desc` is not longer granted, pass an argument descriptor _stronger than_
whichever _explicitly granted permission descriptor_ is _stronger than_ `desc`.

```ts
// deno run --allow-read=/foo main.ts
const desc = { name: "read", path: "/foo/bar" } as const;
console.log(await Deno.permissions.revoke(desc)); // Insufficient.
// PermissionStatus { state: "granted" }
const strongDesc = { name: "read", path: "/foo" } as const;
await Deno.permissions.revoke(strongDesc); // Good.
console.log(await Deno.permissions.query(desc));

## Program lifecycle

Deno supports browser compatible lifecycle events: `load` and `unload`. You can
use these events to provide setup and cleanup code in your program.

Listeners for `load` events can be asynchronous and will be awaited. Listeners
for `unload` events need to be synchronous. Both events cannot be cancelled.

Example:

**main.ts**

```ts
import "./imported.ts";
const handler = (e: Event): void => {
  console.log(`got ${e.type} event in event handler (main)`);
};
window.addEventListener("load", handler);
window.addEventListener("unload", handler);
window.onload = (e: Event): void => {
  console.log(`got ${e.type} event in onload function (main)`);
};
window.onunload = (e: Event): void => {
  console.log(`got ${e.type} event in onunload function (main)`);
};
console.log("log from main script");
```

**imported.ts**

```ts
const handler = (e: Event): void => {
  console.log(`got ${e.type} event in event handler (imported)`);
};
window.addEventListener("load", handler);
window.addEventListener("unload", handler);
window.onload = (e: Event): void => {
  console.log(`got ${e.type} event in onload function (imported)`);
};
window.onunload = (e: Event): void => {
  console.log(`got ${e.type} event in onunload function (imported)`);
};
console.log("log from imported script");
```

Note that you can use both `window.addEventListener` and
`window.onload`/`window.onunload` to define handlers for events. There is a
major difference between them, let's run the example:

```shell
$ deno run main.ts
log from imported script
log from main script
got load event in event handler (imported)
got load event in event handler (main)
got load event in onload function (main)
got unload event in event handler (imported)
got unload event in event handler (main)
got unload event in onunload function (main)
```

All listeners added using `window.addEventListener` were run, but
`window.onload` and `window.onunload` defined in `main.ts` overrode handlers
defined in `imported.ts`.

In other words, you can register multiple `window.addEventListener` `"load"` or
`"unload"` events, but only the last loaded `window.onload` or `window.onunload`
event handlers will be executed. It is preferable to use `addEventListener` when
possible for this reason.

## Stability

As of Deno 1.0.0, the `Deno` namespace APIs are stable. That means we will
strive to make code working under 1.0.0 continue to work in future versions.

However, not all of Deno's features are ready for production yet. Features which
are not ready, because they are still in draft phase, are locked behind the
`--unstable` command line flag.

```shell
deno run --unstable mod_which_uses_unstable_stuff.ts
```

Passing this flag does a few things:

- It enables the use of unstable APIs during runtime.
- It adds the
  [`lib.deno.unstable.d.ts`](https://doc.deno.land/https/raw.githubusercontent.com/denoland/deno/main/cli/dts/lib.deno.unstable.d.ts)
  file to the list of TypeScript definitions that are used for type checking.
  This includes the output of `deno types`.

You should be aware that many unstable APIs have **not undergone a security
review**, are likely to have **breaking API changes** in the future, and are
**not ready for production**.

### Standard modules

Deno's standard modules (https://deno.land/std/) are not yet stable. We
currently version the standard modules differently from the CLI to reflect this.
Note that unlike the `Deno` namespace, the use of the standard modules do not
require the `--unstable` flag (unless the standard module itself makes use of an
unstable Deno feature).

# Web Platform APIs

Deno aims to use web platform APIs (like `fetch`) instead of inventing a new
proprietary API where it makes sense. These APIs generally follow the
specifications and should match the implementation in Chrome and Firefox. In
some cases it makes sense to deviate from the spec slightly, because of the
different security model Deno has.

Here is a list of web platform APIs Deno implements:

## `fetch` API

### Overview

The `fetch` API can be used to make HTTP requests. It is implemented as
specified in the [WHATWG `fetch` spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/).

You can find documentation about this API on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Spec deviations

- The Deno user agent does not have a cookie jar. As such, the `set-cookie`
  header on a response is not processed, or filtered from the visible response
  headers.
- Deno does not follow the same-origin policy, because the Deno user agent
  currently does not have the concept of origins, and it does not have a cookie
  jar. This means Deno does not need to protect against leaking authenticated
  data cross origin. Because of this Deno does not implement the following
  sections of the WHATWG `fetch` specification:
  - Section `3.1. 'Origin' header`.
  - Section `3.2. CORS protocol`.
  - Section `3.5. CORB`.
  - Section `3.6. 'Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy' header`.
  - `Atomic HTTP redirect handling`.
  - The `opaqueredirect` response type.
- A `fetch` with a `redirect` mode of `manual` will return a `basic` response
  rather than an `opaqueredirect` response.

## `CustomEvent`, `EventTarget` and `EventListener`

### Overview

The DOM Event API can be used to dispatch and listen to events happening in an
application. It is implemented as specified in the
[WHATWG DOM spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#events).

You can find documentation about this API on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget).

### Spec deviations

- Events do not bubble, because Deno does not have a DOM hierarchy, so there is
  no tree for Events to bubble/capture through.

## Web Worker API

### Overview

The WebWorker API can be used to executing code in a separate thread. It is
implemented as specified in the
[WHATWG HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#workers).

You can find documentation about this API on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker).

### Spec deviations

- Currently creating workers from blob URLs is not supported.
- Currently posted data is serialized to JSON instead of structured cloning.
- Currently object ownership cannot be transferred between workers.

## Other APIs

- [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)
- [Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console)
- [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)
- [Performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance)
- [setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout)
- [Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API)
- [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)
- [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)
- [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)

## Typings

The TypeScript definitions for the implemented web APIs can be found in the
[`lib.deno.shared_globals.d.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/$CLI_VERSION/cli/dts/lib.deno.shared_globals.d.ts)
and
[`lib.deno.window.d.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/$CLI_VERSION/cli/dts/lib.deno.window.d.ts)
files.

Definitions that are specific to workers can be found in the
[`lib.deno.worker.d.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/$CLI_VERSION/cli/dts/lib.deno.worker.d.ts)
file.

## Web Storage API

As of Deno 1.10, the Web Storage API (`localStorage` & `sessionStorage`) was
introduced, which through `localStorage` allows persistent storage, whereas
`sessionStorage` is a non-persistent memory-based storage.

To use persistent storage, you need to pass the `--location` flag. The location
for persistent storage is listed in `deno info`, and additionally passing the
`--location` will give you the path for the specified origin.

To learn more about the Web Storage APIs, visit the
[MDN page on Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage).

### Example

The following snippet accesses the local storage bucket for the current origin
and adds a data item to it using `setItem()`.

```ts
localStorage.setItem("myDemo", "Deno App");
```

The syntax for reading the localStorage item is as follows:

```ts
const cat = localStorage.getItem("myDemo");
```

The syntax for removing the localStorage item is as follows:

```ts
localStorage.removeItem("myDemo");
```

The syntax for removing all the localStorage items is as follows:

```ts
localStorage.clear();
```

## Workers

Deno supports
[`Web Worker API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker).

Workers can be used to run code on multiple threads. Each instance of `Worker`
is run on a separate thread, dedicated only to that worker.

Currently Deno supports only `module` type workers; thus it's essential to pass
the `type: "module"` option when creating a new worker.

Use of relative module specifiers in the main worker are only supported with
`--location <href>` passed on the CLI. This is not recommended for portability.
You can instead use the `URL` constructor and `import.meta.url` to easily create
a specifier for some nearby script. Dedicated workers, however, have a location
and this capability by default.

```ts
// Good
new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });
// Bad
new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href);
new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, { type: "classic" });
new Worker("./worker.js", { type: "module" });
```

### Instantiation permissions

Creating a new `Worker` instance is similar to a dynamic import; therefore Deno
requires appropriate permission for this action.

For workers using local modules; `--allow-read` permission is required:

**main.ts**

```ts
new Worker(new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });
```

**worker.ts**

```ts
console.log("hello world");
self.close();
```

```shell
$ deno run main.ts
error: Uncaught PermissionDenied: read access to "./worker.ts", run again with the --allow-read flag
$ deno run --allow-read main.ts
hello world
```

For workers using remote modules; `--allow-net` permission is required:

**main.ts**

```ts
new Worker("https://example.com/worker.ts", { type: "module" });
```

**worker.ts** (at https[]()://example.com/worker.ts)

```ts
console.log("hello world");
self.close();
```

```shell
$ deno run main.ts
error: Uncaught PermissionDenied: net access to "https://example.com/worker.ts", run again with the --allow-net flag
$ deno run --allow-net main.ts
hello world
```

### Using Deno in worker

> This is an unstable Deno feature. Learn more about
> [unstable features](./stability.md).
By default the `Deno` namespace is not available in worker scope.

To enable the `Deno` namespace pass `deno.namespace = true` option when creating
new worker:

**main.js**

```ts
const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
  type: "module",
  deno: {
    namespace: true,
  },
});
worker.postMessage({ filename: "./log.txt" });
```

**worker.js**

```ts
self.onmessage = async (e) => {
  const { filename } = e.data;
  const text = await Deno.readTextFile(filename);
  console.log(text);
  self.close();
};
```

**log.txt**

```
hello world
```

```shell
$ deno run --allow-read --unstable main.js
hello world
```

### Specifying worker permissions

> This is an unstable Deno feature. Learn more about
> [unstable features](./stability.md).
The permissions available for the worker are analogous to the CLI permission
flags, meaning every permission enabled there can be disabled at the level of
the Worker API. You can find a more detailed description of each of the
permission options [here](../getting_started/permissions.md).

By default a worker will inherit permissions from the thread it was created in,
however in order to allow users to limit the access of this worker we provide
the `deno.permissions` option in the worker API.

- For permissions that support granular access you can pass in a list of the
  desired resources the worker will have access to, and for those who only have
  the on/off option you can pass true/false respectively.

  ```ts
  const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
    type: "module",
    deno: {
      namespace: true,
      permissions: {
        net: [
          "https://deno.land/",
        ],
        read: [
          new URL("./file_1.txt", import.meta.url),
          new URL("./file_2.txt", import.meta.url),
        ],
        write: false,
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- Granular access permissions receive both absolute and relative routes as
  arguments, however take into account that relative routes will be resolved
  relative to the file the worker is instantiated in, not the path the worker
  file is currently in

  ```ts
  const worker = new Worker(
    new URL("./worker/worker.js", import.meta.url).href,
    {
      type: "module",
      deno: {
        namespace: true,
        permissions: {
          read: [
            "/home/user/Documents/deno/worker/file_1.txt",
            "./worker/file_2.txt",
          ],
        },
      },
    },
  );
  ```

- Both `deno.permissions` and its children support the option `"inherit"`, which
  implies it will borrow its parent permissions.

  ```ts
  // This worker will inherit its parent permissions
  const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
    type: "module",
    deno: {
      namespace: true,
      permissions: "inherit",
    },
  });
  ```

  ```ts
  // This worker will inherit only the net permissions of its parent
  const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
    type: "module",
    deno: {
      namespace: true,
      permissions: {
        env: false,
        hrtime: false,
        net: "inherit",
        plugin: false,
        read: false,
        run: false,
        write: false,
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- Not specifying the `deno.permissions` option or one of its children will cause
  the worker to inherit by default.

  ```ts
  // This worker will inherit its parent permissions
  const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
    type: "module",
  });
  ```

  ```ts
  // This worker will inherit all the permissions of its parent BUT net
  const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
    type: "module",
    deno: {
      namespace: true,
      permissions: {
        net: false,
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- You can disable the permissions of the worker all together by passing `"none"`
  to the `deno.permissions` option.

  ```ts
  // This worker will not have any permissions enabled
  const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url).href, {
    type: "module",
    deno: {
      namespace: true,
      permissions: "none",
    },
  });
  ```

# Standard library

Deno provides a set of standard modules that are audited by the core team and
are guaranteed to work with Deno.

Standard library is available at: https://deno.land/std/

## Versioning and stability

Standard library is not yet stable and therefore it is versioned differently
than Deno. For latest release consult https://deno.land/std/ or
https://deno.land/std/version.ts. The standard library is released each time
Deno is released.

We strongly suggest to always use imports with pinned version of standard
library to avoid unintended changes. For example, rather than linking to the
default branch of code, which may change at any time, potentially causing
compilation errors or unexpected behavior:

```typescript
// import the latest release, this should be avoided
import { copy } from "https://deno.land/std/fs/copy.ts";
```

instead, used a version of the std library which is immutable and will not
change:

```typescript
// imports from v$STD_VERSION of std, never changes
import { copy } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/copy.ts";
```

## Troubleshooting

Some of the modules provided in standard library use unstable Deno APIs.

Trying to run such modules without `--unstable` CLI flag ends up with a lot of
TypeScript errors suggesting that some APIs in the `Deno` namespace do not
exist:

```typescript
// main.ts
import { copy } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/copy.ts";
copy("log.txt", "log-old.txt");
```

```shell
$ deno run --allow-read --allow-write main.ts
Compile file:///dev/deno/main.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/copy.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/ensure_dir.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/_util.ts
error: TS2339 [ERROR]: Property 'utime' does not exist on type 'typeof Deno'. 'Deno.utime' is an unstable API. Did you forget to run with the '--unstable' flag?
    await Deno.utime(dest, statInfo.atime, statInfo.mtime);
               ~~~~~
    at https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/copy.ts:92:16
TS2339 [ERROR]: Property 'utimeSync' does not exist on type 'typeof Deno'. 'Deno.utimeSync' is an unstable API. Did you forget to run with the '--unstable' flag?
    Deno.utimeSync(dest, statInfo.atime, statInfo.mtime);
         ~~~~~~~~~
    at https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fs/copy.ts:103:10
```

Solution to that problem requires adding `--unstable` flag:

```shell
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --unstable main.ts
```

To make sure that API producing error is unstable check
[`lib.deno.unstable.d.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/$CLI_VERSION/cli/dts/lib.deno.unstable.d.ts)
declaration.

This problem should be fixed in the near future. Feel free to omit the flag if
the particular modules you depend on compile successfully without it.

# Testing

Deno has a built-in test runner that you can use for testing JavaScript or
TypeScript code.

`deno test` will search in `./*` and `./**/*` recursively, for test files:

- named `test.{ts, tsx, js, mjs, jsx}`,
- or ending with `.test.{ts, tsx, js, mjs, jsx}`,
- or ending with `_test.{ts, tsx, js, mjs, jsx}`

## Writing tests

To define a test you need to register it with a call to `Deno.test` with a name
and function to be tested. There are two styles you can use.

```ts
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";
// Simple name and function, compact form, but not configurable
Deno.test("hello world #1", () => {
  const x = 1 + 2;
  assertEquals(x, 3);
});
// Fully fledged test definition, longer form, but configurable (see below)
Deno.test({
  name: "hello world #2",
  fn: () => {
    const x = 1 + 2;
    assertEquals(x, 3);
  },
});
```

### Async functions

You can also test asynchronous code by passing a test function that returns a
promise. For this you can use the `async` keyword when defining a function:

```ts
import { delay } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/async/delay.ts";
Deno.test("async hello world", async () => {
  const x = 1 + 2;
  // await some async task
  await delay(100);
  if (x !== 3) {
    throw Error("x should be equal to 3");
  }
});
```

## Running tests

To run the test, call `deno test` with the file that contains your test
function. You can also omit the file name, in which case all tests in the
current directory (recursively) that match the glob
`{*_,*.,}test.{js,mjs,ts,jsx,tsx}` will be run. If you pass a directory, all
files in the directory that match this glob will be run.

```shell
# Run all tests in the current directory and all sub-directories
deno test
# Run all tests in the util directory
deno test util/
# Run just my_test.ts
deno test my_test.ts
```

`deno test` uses the same permission model as `deno run` and therefore will
require, for example, `--allow-write` to write to the file system during
testing.

To see all runtime options with `deno test`, you can reference the command line
help:

```shell
deno help test
```

## Filtering

There are a number of options to filter the tests you are running.

### Command line filtering

Tests can be run individually or in groups using the command line `--filter`
option.

The filter flags accept a string or a pattern as value.

Assuming the following tests:

```ts
Deno.test({ name: "my-test", fn: myTest });
Deno.test({ name: "test-1", fn: test1 });
Deno.test({ name: "test2", fn: test2 });
```

This command will run all of these tests because they all contain the word
"test".

```shell
deno test --filter "test" tests/
```

On the flip side, the following command uses a pattern and will run the second
and third tests.

```shell
deno test --filter "/test-*\d/" tests/
```

_To let Deno know that you want to use a pattern, wrap your filter with
forward-slashes like the JavaScript syntactic sugar for a REGEX._

### Test definition filtering

Within the tests themselves, you have two options for filtering.

#### Filtering out (Ignoring these tests)

Sometimes you want to ignore tests based on some sort of condition (for example
you only want a test to run on Windows). For this you can use the `ignore`
boolean in the test definition. If it is set to true the test will be skipped.

```ts
Deno.test({
  name: "do macOS feature",
  ignore: Deno.build.os !== "darwin",
  fn() {
    doMacOSFeature();
  },
});
```

#### Filtering in (Only run these tests)

Sometimes you may be in the middle of a problem within a large test class and
you would like to focus on just that test and ignore the rest for now. For this
you can use the `only` option to tell the test framework to only run tests with
this set to true. Multiple tests can set this option. While the test run will
report on the success or failure of each test, the overall test run will always
fail if any test is flagged with `only`, as this is a temporary measure only
which disables nearly all of your tests.

```ts
Deno.test({
  name: "Focus on this test only",
  only: true,
  fn() {
    testComplicatedStuff();
  },
});
```

## Failing fast

If you have a long running test suite and wish for it to stop on the first
failure, you can specify the `--fail-fast` flag when running the suite.

```shell
deno test --fail-fast
```

## Assertions

To help developers write tests the Deno standard library comes with a built in
[assertions module](https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts) which
can be imported from `https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts`.

```js
import { assert } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";
Deno.test("Hello Test", () => {
  assert("Hello");
});
```

The assertions module provides 10 assertions:

- `assert(expr: unknown, msg = ""): asserts expr`
- `assertEquals(actual: unknown, expected: unknown, msg?: string): void`
- `assertExists(actual: unknown,msg?: string): void`
- `assertNotEquals(actual: unknown, expected: unknown, msg?: string): void`
- `assertStrictEquals(actual: unknown, expected: unknown, msg?: string): void`
- `assertStringIncludes(actual: string, expected: string, msg?: string): void`
- `assertArrayIncludes(actual: unknown[], expected: unknown[], msg?: string): void`
- `assertMatch(actual: string, expected: RegExp, msg?: string): void`
- `assertNotMatch(actual: string, expected: RegExp, msg?: string): void`
- `assertObjectMatch( actual: Record<PropertyKey, unknown>, expected: Record<PropertyKey, unknown>): void`
- `assertThrows(fn: () => void, ErrorClass?: Constructor, msgIncludes = "", msg?: string): Error`
- `assertThrowsAsync(fn: () => Promise<void>, ErrorClass?: Constructor, msgIncludes = "", msg?: string): Promise<Error>`

### Assert

The assert method is a simple 'truthy' assertion and can be used to assert any
value which can be inferred as true.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert", () => {
  assert(1);
  assert("Hello");
  assert(true);
});
```

### Exists

The `assertExists` can be used to check if a value is not `null` or `undefined`.

```js
assertExists("Denosaurus");
Deno.test("Test Assert Exists", () => {
  assertExists("Denosaurus");
  assertExists(false);
  assertExists(0);
});
```

### Equality

There are three equality assertions available, `assertEquals()`,
`assertNotEquals()` and `assertStrictEquals()`.

The `assertEquals()` and `assertNotEquals()` methods provide a general equality
check and are capable of asserting equality between primitive types and objects.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Equals", () => {
  assertEquals(1, 1);
  assertEquals("Hello", "Hello");
  assertEquals(true, true);
  assertEquals(undefined, undefined);
  assertEquals(null, null);
  assertEquals(new Date(), new Date());
  assertEquals(new RegExp("abc"), new RegExp("abc"));
  class Foo {}
  const foo1 = new Foo();
  const foo2 = new Foo();
  assertEquals(foo1, foo2);
});
Deno.test("Test Assert Not Equals", () => {
  assertNotEquals(1, 2);
  assertNotEquals("Hello", "World");
  assertNotEquals(true, false);
  assertNotEquals(undefined, "");
  assertNotEquals(new Date(), Date.now());
  assertNotEquals(new RegExp("abc"), new RegExp("def"));
});
```

By contrast `assertStrictEquals()` provides a simpler, stricter equality check
based on the `===` operator. As a result it will not assert two instances of
identical objects as they won't be referentially the same.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Strict Equals", () => {
  assertStrictEquals(1, 1);
  assertStrictEquals("Hello", "Hello");
  assertStrictEquals(true, true);
  assertStrictEquals(undefined, undefined);
});
```

The `assertStrictEquals()` assertion is best used when you wish to make a
precise check against two primitive types.

### Contains

There are two methods available to assert a value contains a value,
`assertStringIncludes()` and `assertArrayIncludes()`.

The `assertStringIncludes()` assertion does a simple includes check on a string
to see if it contains the expected string.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert String Contains", () => {
  assertStringIncludes("Hello World", "Hello");
});
```

The `assertArrayIncludes()` assertion is slightly more advanced and can find
both a value within an array and an array of values within an array.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Array Contains", () => {
  assertArrayIncludes([1, 2, 3], [1]);
  assertArrayIncludes([1, 2, 3], [1, 2]);
  assertArrayIncludes(Array.from("Hello World"), Array.from("Hello"));
});
```

### Regex

You can assert regular expressions via `assertMatch()` and `assertNotMatch()`
assertions.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Match", () => {
  assertMatch("abcdefghi", new RegExp("def"));
  const basicUrl = new RegExp("^https?://[a-z.]+.com$");
  assertMatch("https://www.google.com", basicUrl);
  assertMatch("http://facebook.com", basicUrl);
});
Deno.test("Test Assert Not Match", () => {
  assertNotMatch("abcdefghi", new RegExp("jkl"));
  const basicUrl = new RegExp("^https?://[a-z.]+.com$");
  assertNotMatch("https://deno.land/", basicUrl);
});
```

### Object

Use `assertObjectMatch` to check that a JavaScript object matches a subset of
the properties of an object.

```js
// Simple subset
assertObjectMatch(
  { foo: true, bar: false },
  {
    foo: true,
  },
);
```

### Throws

There are two ways to assert whether something throws an error in Deno,
`assertThrows()` and `assertThrowsAsync()`. Both assertions allow you to check
an
[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)
has been thrown, the type of error thrown and what the message was.

The difference between the two assertions is `assertThrows()` accepts a standard
function and `assertThrowsAsync()` accepts a function which returns a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

The `assertThrows()` assertion will check an error has been thrown, and
optionally will check the thrown error is of the correct type, and assert the
error message is as expected.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Throws", () => {
  assertThrows(
    () => {
      throw new Error("Panic!");
    },
    Error,
    "Panic!",
  );
});
```

The `assertThrowsAsync()` assertion is a little more complicated, mainly because
it deals with Promises. But basically it will catch thrown errors or rejections
in Promises. You can also optionally check for the error type and error message.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Throws Async", () => {
  assertThrowsAsync(
    () => {
      return new Promise(() => {
        throw new Error("Panic! Threw Error");
      });
    },
    Error,
    "Panic! Threw Error",
  );
  assertThrowsAsync(
    () => {
      return Promise.reject(new Error("Panic! Reject Error"));
    },
    Error,
    "Panic! Reject Error",
  );
});
```

### Custom Messages

Each of Deno's built in assertions allow you to overwrite the standard CLI error
message if you wish. For instance this example will output "Values Don't Match!"
rather than the standard CLI error message.

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert Equal Fail Custom Message", () => {
  assertEquals(1, 2, "Values Don't Match!");
});
```

### Custom Tests

While Deno comes with powerful
[assertions modules](https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts) but
there is always something specific to the project you can add. Creating
`custom assertion function` can improve readability and reduce the amount of
code.

```js
function assertPowerOf(actual: number, expected: number, msg?: string): void {
  let received = actual;
  while (received % expected === 0) received = received / expected;
  if (received !== 1) {
    if (!msg) {
      msg = `actual: "${actual}" expected to be a power of : "${expected}"`;
    }
    throw new AssertionError(msg);
  }
}
```

Use this matcher in your code like this:

```js
Deno.test("Test Assert PowerOf", () => {
  assertPowerOf(8, 2);
  assertPowerOf(11, 4);
});
```

# Test coverage

Deno will collect test coverage into a directory for your code if you specify
the `--coverage` flag when starting `deno test`.

This coverage information is acquired directly from the JavaScript engine (V8)
which is very accurate.

This can then be further processed from the internal format into well known
formats by the `deno coverage` tool.

```bash
# Go into your project's working directory
git clone https://github.com/oakserver/oak && cd oak
# Collect your coverage profile with deno test --coverage=<output_directory>
deno test --coverage=cov_profile
# From this you can get a pretty printed diff of uncovered lines
deno coverage cov_profile
# Or generate an lcov report
deno coverage cov_profile --lcov > cov_profile.lcov
# Which can then be further processed by tools like genhtml
genhtml -o cov_profile/html cov_profile.lcov
```

By default, `deno coverage` will exclude any files matching the regular
expression `test\.(js|mjs|ts|jsx|tsx)` and only consider including specifiers
matching the regular expression `^file:` - ie. remote files will be excluded
from coverage report.

These filters can be overridden using the `--exclude` and `--include` flags. A
module specifier must _match_ the include_regular expression and _not match_ the
exclude_ expression for it to be a part of the report.

# Documentation tests

Deno supports type-checking your documentation examples.

This makes sure that examples within your documentation are up to date and
working.

The basic idea is this:

````ts
/**
 * # Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * const x = 42;
 * ```
 */
````

The triple backticks mark the start and end of code blocks.

If this example was in a file named foo.ts, running `deno test --doc foo.ts`
will extract this example, and then type-check it as a standalone module living
in the same directory as the module being documented.

To document your exports, import the module using a relative path specifier:

````ts
/**
 * # Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { foo } from "./foo.ts";
 * ```
 */
export function foo(): string {
  return "foo";
}

# Test Sanitizers

The test runner offers several sanitizers to ensure that the test behaves in a
reasonable and expected way.

### Resource sanitizer

Certain actions in Deno create resources in the resource table
([learn more here](./contributing/architecture.md)).

These resources should be closed after you are done using them.

For each test definition, the test runner checks that all resources created in
this test have been closed. This is to prevent resource 'leaks'. This is enabled
by default for all tests, but can be disabled by setting the `sanitizeResources`
boolean to false in the test definition.

```ts
Deno.test({
  name: "leaky resource test",
  async fn() {
    await Deno.open("hello.txt");
  },
  sanitizeResources: false,
});
```

### Op sanitizer

The same is true for async operation like interacting with the filesystem. The
test runner checks that each operation you start in the test is completed before
the end of the test. This is enabled by default for all tests, but can be
disabled by setting the `sanitizeOps` boolean to false in the test definition.

```ts
Deno.test({
  name: "leaky operation test",
  fn() {
    setTimeout(function () {}, 1000);
  },
  sanitizeOps: false,
});
```

### Exit sanitizer

There's also the exit sanitizer which ensures that tested code doesn't call
`Deno.exit()` signaling a false test success.

This is enabled by default for all tests, but can be disabled by setting the
`sanitizeExit` boolean to false in the test definition.

```ts
Deno.test({
  name: "false success",
  fn() {
    Deno.exit(0);
  },
  sanitizeExit: false,
});
// This test never runs, because the process exits during "false success" test
Deno.test({
  name: "failing test",
  fn() {
    throw new Error("this test fails");
  },
});

# Built-in tooling

Deno provides some built in tooling that is useful when working with JavaScript
and TypeScript:

- [bundler (`deno bundle`)](./tools/bundler.md)
- [compiling executables (`deno compile`)](./tools/compiler.md)
- [installer (`deno install`)](./tools/script_installer.md)
- [dependency inspector (`deno info`)](./tools/dependency_inspector.md)

## Bundling

`deno bundle [URL]` will output a single JavaScript file, which includes all
dependencies of the specified input. For example:

```bash
deno bundle https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/examples/colors.ts colors.bundle.js
Bundle https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/examples/colors.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/examples/colors.ts
Download https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fmt/colors.ts
Emit "colors.bundle.js" (9.83KB)
```

If you omit the out file, the bundle will be sent to `stdout`.

The bundle can just be run as any other module in Deno would:

```bash
deno run colors.bundle.js
```

The output is a self contained ES Module, where any exports from the main module
supplied on the command line will be available. For example, if the main module
looked something like this:

```ts
export { foo } from "./foo.js";
export const bar = "bar";
```

It could be imported like this:

```ts
import { bar, foo } from "./lib.bundle.js";
```

Bundles can also be loaded in the web browser. The bundle is a self-contained ES
module, and so the attribute of `type` must be set to `"module"`. For example:

```html
<script type="module" src="website.bundle.js"></script>
```

Or you could import it into another ES module to consume:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as website from "website.bundle.js";
</script>
```

## Compiling Executables

`deno compile [--output <OUT>] <SRC>` will compile the script into a
self-contained executable.

```
> deno compile https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts
```

If you omit the `OUT` parameter, the name of the executable file will be
inferred.

### Flags

As with [`deno install`](./script_installer.md), the runtime flags used to
execute the script must be specified at compilation time. This includes
permission flags.

```
> deno compile --allow-read --allow-net https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts
```

[Script arguments](../getting_started/command_line_interface.md#script-arguments)
can be partially embedded.

```
> deno compile --allow-read --allow-net https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts -p 8080
> ./file_server --help
```

### Cross Compilation

You can compile binaries for other platforms by adding the `--target` CLI flag.
Deno currently supports compiling to Windows x64, macOS x64, macOS ARM and Linux
x64. Use `deno compile --help` to list the full values for each compilation
target.

## Documentation Generator

`deno doc` followed by a list of one or more source files will print the JSDoc
documentation for each of the module's **exported** members.

```ts
/**
 * Adds x and y.
 * @param {number} x
 * @param {number} y
 * @returns {number} Sum of x and y
 */
export function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
```

Running the Deno `doc` command, prints the function's JSDoc comment to `stdout`:

```shell
deno doc add.ts
function add(x: number, y: number): number
  Adds x and y. @param {number} x @param {number} y @returns {number} Sum of x and y
```

Use the `--json` flag to output the documentation in JSON format. This JSON
format is consumed by the
[deno doc website](https://github.com/denoland/doc_website) and is used to
generate module documentation.

### Ignore directives

#### Files

To ignore whole file `// deno-lint-ignore-file` directive should placed at the
top of the file:

```ts
// deno-lint-ignore-file
function foo(): any {
  // ...
}
```

Ignore directive must be placed before first statement or declaration:

```ts
// Copyright 2020 the Deno authors. All rights reserved. MIT license.
/**
 * Some JS doc
 **/
// deno-lint-ignore-file
import { bar } from "./bar.js";
function foo(): any {
  // ...
}
```

You can also ignore certain diagnostics in the whole file

```ts
// deno-lint-ignore-file no-explicit-any no-empty
function foo(): any {
  // ...
}
```

#### Diagnostics

To ignore certain diagnostic `// deno-lint-ignore <codes...>` directive should
be placed before offending line. Specifying ignored rule name is required:

```ts
// deno-lint-ignore no-explicit-any
function foo(): any {
  // ...
}
// deno-lint-ignore no-explicit-any explicit-function-return-type
function bar(a: any) {
  // ...
}
```

## Script installer

Deno provides `deno install` to easily install and distribute executable code.

`deno install [OPTIONS...] [URL] [SCRIPT_ARGS...]` will install the script
available at `URL` under the name `EXE_NAME`.

This command creates a thin, executable shell script which invokes `deno` using
the specified CLI flags and main module. It is placed in the installation root's
`bin` directory.

Example:

```shell
$ deno install --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/file_server.ts
[1/1] Compiling https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/file_server.ts
✅ Successfully installed file_server.
/Users/deno/.deno/bin/file_server
```

To change the executable name, use `-n`/`--name`:

```shell
deno install --allow-net --allow-read -n serve https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/file_server.ts
```

The executable name is inferred by default:

- Attempt to take the file stem of the URL path. The above example would become
  'file_server'.
- If the file stem is something generic like 'main', 'mod', 'index' or 'cli',
  and the path has no parent, take the file name of the parent path. Otherwise
  settle with the generic name.
- If the resulting name has an '@...' suffix, strip it.

To change the installation root, use `--root`:

```shell
deno install --allow-net --allow-read --root /usr/local https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/file_server.ts
```

The installation root is determined, in order of precedence:

- `--root` option
- `DENO_INSTALL_ROOT` environment variable
- `$HOME/.deno`

These must be added to the path manually if required.

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.deno/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

You must specify permissions that will be used to run the script at installation
time.

```shell
deno install --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/file_server.ts -p 8080
```

The above command creates an executable called `file_server` that runs with
network and read permissions and binds to port 8080.

For good practice, use the [`import.meta.main`](../examples/module_metadata.md)
idiom to specify the entry point in an executable script.

Example:

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->

```ts
// https://example.com/awesome/cli.ts
async function myAwesomeCli(): Promise<void> {
  -- snip --
}
if (import.meta.main) {
  myAwesomeCli();
}
```

When you create an executable script make sure to let users know by adding an
example installation command to your repository:

```shell
# Install using deno install
$ deno install -n awesome_cli https://example.com/awesome/cli.ts
```

## Configuring TypeScript in Deno

TypeScript comes with a load of different options that can be configured, but
Deno strives to make it easy to use TypeScript with Deno. Lots of different
options frustrates that goal. To make things easier, Deno configures TypeScript
to "just work" and shouldn't require additional configuration.

That being said, Deno does support using a TypeScript configuration file, though
like the rest of Deno, the detection and use of a configuration file is not
automatic. To use a TypeScript configuration file with Deno, you have to provide
a path on the command line. For example:

```
> deno run --config ./tsconfig.json main.ts
```

> ⚠️ Do consider though that if you are creating libraries that require a
> configuration file, all of the consumers of your modules will require that
> configuration file too if you distribute your modules as TypeScript. In
> addition, there could be settings you do in the configuration file that make
> other TypeScript modules incompatible. Honestly it is best to use the Deno
> defaults and to think long and hard about using a configuration file.
### How Deno uses a configuration file

Deno does not process a TypeScript configuration file like `tsc` does, as there
are lots of parts of a TypeScript configuration file that are meaningless in a
Deno context or would cause Deno to not function properly if they were applied.

Deno only looks at the `compilerOptions` section of a configuration file, and
even then it only considers certain compiler options, with the rest being
ignored.

Here is a table of compiler options that can be changed, their default in Deno
and any other notes about that option:

| Option                           | Default                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### What an implied tsconfig.json looks like

It is impossible to get `tsc` to behave like Deno. It is also difficult to get
the TypeScript language service to behave like Deno. This is why we have built a
language service directly into Deno. That being said, it can be useful to
understand what is implied.

If you were to write a `tsconfig.json` for Deno, it would look something like
this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "inlineSourceMap": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "react",
    "lib": ["deno.window"],
    "module": "esnext",
    "strict": true,
    "target": "esnext",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true
  }
}
```

You can't copy paste this into a `tsconfig.json` and get it to work,
specifically because of the built in type libraries that are custom to Deno
which are provided to the TypeScript compiler. This can somewhat be mocked by
running `deno types` on the command line and piping the output to a file and
including that in the files as part of the program, removing the `"lib"` option,
and setting the `"noLib"` option to `true`.

If you use the `--unstable` flag, Deno will change the `"lib"` option to
`[ "deno.window", "deno.unstable" ]`. If you are trying to load a worker, that
is type checked with `"deno.worker"` instead of `"deno.window"`. See
[Type Checking Web Workers](./types#type-checking-web-workers) for more
information on this.

### Using the "lib" property

Deno has several libraries built into it that are not present in other
platforms, like `tsc`. This is what enables Deno to properly check code written
for Deno. In some situations though, this automatic behavior can cause
challenges, for example like writing code that is intended to also run in a
browser. In these situations the `"lib"` property of a `tsconfig.json` can be
used to modify the behavior of Deno when type checking code.

The built-in libraries that are of interest to users:

- `"deno.ns"` - This includes all the custom `Deno` global namespace APIs plus
  the Deno additions to `import.meta`. This should generally not conflict with
  other libraries or global types.
- `"deno.unstable"` - This includes the addition unstable `Deno` global
  namespace APIs.
- `"deno.window"` - This is the "default" library used when checking Deno main
  runtime scripts. It includes the `"deno.ns"` as well as other type libraries
  for the extensions that are built into Deno. This library will conflict with
  libraries like `"dom"` and `"dom.iterable"` that are standard TypeScript
  libraries.
- `"deno.worker"` - This is the library used when checking a Deno web worker
  script. For more information about web workers, check out
  [Type Checking Web Workers](./types#type-checking-web-workers).
- `"dom.asynciterable"` - TypeScript currently does not include the DOM async
  iterables that Deno implements (plus several browsers), so we have implemented
  it ourselves until it becomes available in TypeScript.

These are common libraries that Deno doesn't use, but are useful when writing
code that is intended to also work in another runtime:

- `"dom"` - The main browser global library that ships with TypeScript. The type
  definitions conflict in many ways with `"deno.window"` and so if `"dom"` is
  used, then consider using just `"deno.ns"` to expose the Deno specific APIs.
- `"dom.iterable"` - The iterable extensions to the browser global library.
- `"scripthost"` - The library for the Microsoft Windows Script Host.
- `"webworker"` - The main library for web workers in the browser. Like `"dom"`
  this will conflict with `"deno.window"` or `"deno.worker"`, so consider using
  just `"deno.ns"` to expose the Deno specific APIs.
- `"webworker.importscripts"` - The library that exposes the `importScripts()`
  API in the web worker.
- `"webworker.iterable"` - The library that adds iterables to objects within a
  web worker. Modern browsers support this.

#### Targeting Deno and the Browser

A common use case is writing code that works in Deno and the browser, and have
the code "sniff" to determine if it is running in the browser or in Deno. If
that is the case a common configuration of a `tsconfig.json` would look like
this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "dom.asynciterable", "deno.ns"]
  }
}
```

This should allow most code to be type checked properly by Deno.

If you expect to run the code in Deno with the `--unstable` flag, then you will
want to add that library to the mix as well:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "dom.asynciterable",
      "deno.ns",
      "deno.unstable"
    ]
  }
}
```

Typically when you use the `"lib"` option in TypeScript, you need to include an
"es" library as well. In the case of `"deno.ns"` and `"deno.unstable"`, they
automatically include `"esnext"` when you bring them in.

The biggest "danger" when doing something like this, is that the type checking
is significantly looser, and there is no way to validate that you are doing
sufficient and effective feature detection in your code, which may lead to what
could be trivial errors becoming runtime errors.

### Using the "types" property

The `"types"` property in `"compilerOptions"` can be used to specify arbitrary
type definitions to include when type checking a programme. For more information
on this see
[Using ambient or global types](./types#using-ambient-or-global-types).

## FAQs about TypeScript in Deno

### Can I use TypeScript not written for Deno?

Maybe. That is the best answer, we are afraid. For lots of reasons, Deno has
chosen to have fully qualified module specifiers. In part this is because it
treats TypeScript as a first class language. Also, Deno uses explicit module
resolution, with no _magic_. This is effectively the same way browsers
themselves work, though they don't obviously support TypeScript directly. If the
TypeScript modules use imports that don't have these design decisions in mind,
they may not work under Deno.

Also, in recent versions of Deno (starting with 1.5), we have started to use a
Rust library to do transformations of TypeScript to JavaScript in certain
scenarios. Because of this, there are certain situations in TypeScript where
type information is required, and therefore those are not supported under Deno.
If you are using `tsc` as stand-alone, the setting to use is `"isolatedModules"`
and setting it to `true` to help ensure that your code can be properly handled
by Deno.

One of the ways to deal with the extension and the lack of Node.js non-standard
resolution logic is to use
[import maps](../linking_to_external_code/import_maps.md) which would allow you
to specify "packages" of bare specifiers which then Deno could resolve and load.

### What version(s) of TypeScript does Deno support?

Deno is built with a specific version of TypeScript. To find out what this is,
type the following on the command line:

```shell
> deno --version
```

The TypeScript version (along with the version of Deno and v8) will be printed.
Deno tries to keep up to date with general releases of TypeScript, providing
them in the next patch or minor release of Deno.

### There was a breaking change in the version of TypeScript that Deno uses, why did you break my program?

We do not consider changes in behavior or breaking changes in TypeScript
releases as breaking changes for Deno. TypeScript is a generally mature language
and breaking changes in TypeScript are almost always "good things" making code
more sound, and it is best that we all keep our code sound. If there is a
blocking change in the version of TypeScript and it isn't suitable to use an
older release of Deno until the problem can be resolved, then you should be able
to use `--no-check` to skip type checking all together.

In addition you can utilize `@ts-ignore` to _ignore_ a specific error in code
that you control. You can also replace whole dependencies, using
[import maps](../linking_to_external_code/import_maps), for situations where a
dependency of a dependency isn't being maintained or has some sort of breaking
change you want to bypass while waiting for it to be updated.

### How do I write code that works in Deno and a browser, but still type checks?

You can do this by using a `tsconfig.json` file with the `--config` option on
the command line and adjusting the `"lib"` option in the `"compilerOptions"` in
the file. For more information see
[Targeting Deno and the Browser](./configuration#targeting-deno-and-the-browser).

### Why are you forcing me to use isolated modules, why can't I use const enums with Deno, why do I need to do export type?

As of Deno 1.5 we defaulted to _isolatedModules_ to `true` and in Deno 1.6 we
removed the options to set it back to `false` via a configuration file. The
_isolatedModules_ option forces the TypeScript compiler to check and emit
TypeScript as if each module would stand on its own. TypeScript has a few _type
directed emits_ in the language at the moment. While not allowing type directed
emits into the language was a design goal for TypeScript, it has happened
anyways. This means that the TypeScript compiler needs to understand the
erasable types in the code to determine what to emit, which when you are trying
to make a fully erasable type system on top of JavaScript, that becomes a
problem.

When people started transpiling TypeScript without `tsc`, these type directed
emits became a problem, since the likes of Babel simply try to erase the types
without needing to understand the types to direct the emit. In the internals of
Deno we have started to use a Rust based emitter which allows us to optionally
skip type checking and generates the bundles for things like `deno bundle`. Like
all transpilers, it doesn't care about the types, it just tries to erase them.
This means in certain situations we cannot support those type directed emits.

So instead of trying to get every user to understand when and how we could
support the type directed emits, we made the decision to disable the use of them
by forcing the _isolatedModules_ option to `true`. This means that even when we
are using the TypeScript compiler to emit the code, it will follow the same
"rules" that the Rust based emitter follows.

This means that certain language features are not supportable. Those features
are:

- Re-exporting of types is ambiguous and requires knowing if the source module
  is exporting runtime code or just type information. Therefore, it is
  recommended that you use `import type` and `export type` for type only imports
  and exports. This will help ensure that when the code is emitted, that all the
  types are erased.
- `const enum` is not supported. `const enum`s require type information to
  direct the emit, as `const enum`s get written out as hard coded values.
  Especially when `const enum`s get exported, they are a type system only
  construct.
- `export =` and `import =` are legacy TypeScript syntax which we do not
  support.
- Only `declare namespace` is support. Runtime `namespace` is legacy TypeScript
  syntax that is not supported.

### Why don't you support language service plugins or transformer plugins?

While `tsc` supports language service plugins, Deno does not. Deno does not
always use the built in TypeScript compiler to do what it does, and the
complexity of adding support for a language service plugin is not feasible.
TypeScript does not support emitter plugins, but there are a few community
projects which _hack_ emitter plugins into TypeScript. First, we wouldn't want
to support something that TypeScript doesn't support, plus we do not always use
the TypeScript compiler for the emit, which would mean we would need to ensure
we supported it in all modes, and the other emitter is written in Rust, meaning
that any emitter plugin for TypeScript wouldn't be available for the Rust
emitter.

The TypeScript in Deno isn't intended to be a fully flexible TypeScript
compiler. Its main purpose is to ensure that TypeScript and JavaScript can run
under Deno. The secondary ability to do TypeScript and JavaScript emitting via
the runtime API `Deno.emit()` is intended to be simple and straight forward and
support a certain set of use cases.

### How do I combine Deno code with non-Deno code in my IDE?

The Deno language server supports the ability to have a "per-resource"
configuration of enabling Deno or not. This also requires a client IDE to
support this ability. For Visual Studio Code the official
[Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
supports the vscode concept of
[multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).
This means you just need to add folders to the workspace and set the
`deno.enable` setting as required on each folder.

For other IDEs, the client extensions needs to support the similar IDE concepts.

## Migrating to and from JavaScript

One of the advantages of Deno is that it treats TypeScript and JavaScript pretty
equally. This might mean that transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript or
even from TypeScript to JavaScript is something you want to accomplish. There
are several features of Deno that can help with this.

### Type checking JavaScript

You might have some JavaScript that you would like to ensure is more type sound
but you don't want to go through a process of adding type annotations
everywhere.

Deno supports using the TypeScript type checker to type check JavaScript. You
can mark any individual file by adding the check JavaScript pragma to the file:

```js
// @ts-check
```

This will cause the type checker to infer type information about the JavaScript
code and raise any issues as diagnostic issues.

These can be turned on for all JavaScript files in a program by providing a
configuration file with the check JS option enabled:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "checkJs": true
  }
}
```

And setting the `--config` option on the command line.

### Using JSDoc in JavaScript

If you are type checking JavaScript, or even importing JavaScript into
TypeScript you can use JSDoc in JavaScript to express more types information
than can just be inferred from the code itself. Deno supports this without any
additional configuration, you simply need to annotate the code in line with the
supported
[TypeScript JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html).
For example to set the type of an array:

```js
/** @type {string[]} */
const a = [];
```

### Skipping type checking

You might have TypeScript code that you are experimenting with, where the syntax
is valid but not fully type safe. You can always bypass type checking for a
whole program by passing the `--no-check`.

You can also skip whole files being type checked, including JavaScript if you
have check JS enabled, by using the no-check pragma:

```js
// @ts-nocheck
```

### Just renaming JS files to TS files

While this might work in some cases, it has some severe limits in Deno. This is
because Deno, by default, runs type checking in what is called _strict mode_.
This means a lot of unclear or ambiguous situations where are not caught in
non-strict mode will result in diagnostics being generated, and JavaScript is
nothing but unclear and ambiguous when it comes to types.

## Overview of TypeScript in Deno

One of the benefits of Deno is that it treats TypeScript as a first class
language, just like JavaScript or Web Assembly, when running code in Deno. What
that means is you can run or import TypeScript without installing anything more
than the Deno CLI.

_But wait a minute, does Deno really run TypeScript?_ you might be asking
yourself. Well, depends on what you mean by run. One could argue that in a
browser you don't actually _run_ JavaScript either. The JavaScript engine in the
browser translates the JavaScript to a series of operation codes, which it then
executes in a sandbox. So it translates JavaScript to something close to
assembly. Even Web Assembly goes through a similar translation, in that Web
Assembly is architecture agnostic while it needs to be translated into the
machine specific operation codes needed for the particular platform architecture
it is running on. So when we say TypeScript is a first class language in Deno,
we mean that we try to make the user experience in authoring and running
TypeScript as easy and straightforward as JavaScript and Web Assembly.

Behind the scenes, we use a combination of technologies, in Rust and JavaScript,
to provide that experience.

### How does it work?

At a high level, Deno converts TypeScript (as well as TSX and JSX) into
JavaScript. It does this via a combination of the
[TypeScript compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), which we build
into Deno, and a Rust library called [swc](https://swc.rs/). When the code has
been type checked and transformed, it is stored in a cache, ready for the next
run without the need to convert it from its source to JavaScript again.

You can see this cache location by running `deno info`:

```shell
> deno info
DENO_DIR location: "/path/to/cache/deno"
Remote modules cache: "/path/to/cache/deno/deps"
TypeScript compiler cache: "/path/to/cache/deno/gen"
```

If you were to look in that cache, you would see a directory structure that
mimics that source directory structure and individual `.js` and `.meta` files
(also potentially `.map` files). The `.js` file is the transformed source file
while the `.meta` file contains meta data we want to cache about the file, which
at the moment contains a _hash_ of the source module that helps us manage cache
invalidation. You might also see a `.buildinfo` file as well, which is a
TypeScript compiler incremental build information file, which we cache to help
speed up type checking.

### Type Checking

One of the main advantages of TypeScript is that you can make code more type
safe, so that what would be syntactically valid JavaScript becomes TypeScript
with warnings about being "unsafe".

In Deno we handle TypeScript in two major ways. We can type check TypeScript,
the default, or you can opt into skipping that checking using the `--no-check`
flag. For example if you had a program you wanted to run, normally you would do
something like this:

```
deno run --allow-net my_server.ts
```

But if you wanted to skip the type checking, you would do something like this:

```
deno run --allow-net --no-check my_server.ts
```

Type checking can take a significant amount of time, especially if you are
working on a code base where you are making a lot of changes. We have tried to
optimise the type checking, but it still comes at a cost. If you just want to
hack at some code, or if you are working in an IDE which is type checking your
code as you author it, using `--no-check` can certainly speed up the process of
running TypeScript in Deno.

### Determining the type of file

Since Deno supports JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX modules, Deno has to make a
decision about how to treat each of these kinds of files. For local modules,
Deno makes this determination based fully on the extension. When the extension
is absent in a local file, it is assumed to be JavaScript.

For remote modules, the media type (mime-type) is used to determine the type of
the module, where the path of the module is used to help influence the file
type, when it is ambiguous what type of file it is.

For example, a `.d.ts` file and a `.ts` file have different semantics in
TypeScript as well as have different ways they need to be handled in Deno. While
we expect to convert a `.ts` file into JavaScript, a `.d.ts` file contains no
"runnable" code, and is simply describing types (often of "plain" JavaScript).
So when we fetch a remote module, the media type for a `.ts.` and `.d.ts` file
looks the same. So we look at the path, and if we see something that has a path
that ends with `.d.ts` we treat it as a type definition only file instead of
"runnable" TypeScript.

#### Supported media types

The following table provides a list of media types which Deno supports when
identifying the type of file of a remote module:

| Media Type                 | How File is Handled                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `application/typescript`   | TypeScript (with path extension influence)                  |
| `text/typescript`          | TypeScript (with path extension influence)                  |
| `video/vnd.dlna.mpeg-tts`  | TypeScript (with path extension influence)                  |
| `video/mp2t`               | TypeScript (with path extension influence)                  |
| `application/x-typescript` | TypeScript (with path extension influence)                  |
| `application/javascript`   | JavaScript (with path extensions influence)                 |
| `text/javascript`          | JavaScript (with path extensions influence)                 |
| `application/ecmascript`   | JavaScript (with path extensions influence)                 |
| `text/ecmascript`          | JavaScript (with path extensions influence)                 |
| `application/x-javascript` | JavaScript (with path extensions influence)                 |
| `application/node`         | JavaScript (with path extensions influence)                 |
| `text/jsx`                 | JSX                                                         |
| `text/tsx`                 | TSX                                                         |
| `text/plain`               | Attempt to determine that path extension, otherwise unknown |
| `application/octet-stream` | Attempt to determine that path extension, otherwise unknown |

### Strict by default

Deno type checks TypeScript in _strict_ mode by default, and the TypeScript core
team recommends _strict_ mode as a sensible default. This mode generally enables
features of TypeScript that probably should have been there from the start, but
as TypeScript continued to evolve, would be breaking changes for existing code.

### Mixing JavaScript and TypeScript

By default, Deno does not type check JavaScript. This can be changed, and is
discussed further in [Configuring TypeScript in Deno](./configuration.md). Deno
does support JavaScript importing TypeScript and TypeScript importing
JavaScript, in complex scenarios.

An important note though is that when type checking TypeScript, by default Deno
will "read" all the JavaScript in order to be able to evaluate how it might have
an impact on the TypeScript types. The type checker will do the best it can to
figure out what the types are of the JavaScript you import into TypeScript,
including reading any JSDoc comments. Details of this are discussed in detail in
the [Types and type declarations](./types.md) section.

### Diagnostics are terminal

While `tsc` by default will still emit JavaScript when run while encountering
diagnostic (type checking) issues, Deno currently treats them as terminal. It
will halt on these warnings, not cache any of the emitted files, and exit the
process.

In order to avoid this, you will either need to resolve the issue, utilise the
`// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` pragmas, or utilise `--no-check` to
bypass type checking all together.

### Type resolution

One of the core design principles of Deno is to avoid non-standard module
resolution, and this applies to type resolution as well. If you want to utilise
JavaScript that has type definitions (e.g. a `.d.ts` file), you have to
explicitly tell Deno about this. The details of how this is accomplished are
covered in the [Types and type declarations](./types.md) section.

## Runtime compiler APIs

> ⚠️ The runtime compiler API is unstable (and requires the `--unstable` flag to
> be used to enable it).
The runtime compiler API allows access to the internals of Deno to be able to
type check, transpile and bundle JavaScript and TypeScript. As of Deno 1.7,
several disparate APIs we consolidated into a single API, `Deno.emit()`.

### Deno.emit()

The API is defined in the `Deno` namespace as:

```ts
function emit(
  rootSpecifier: string | URL,
  options?: EmitOptions,
): Promise<EmitResult>;
```

The emit options are defined in the `Deno` namespace as:

```ts
interface EmitOptions {
  /** Indicate that the source code should be emitted to a single file
    * JavaScript bundle that is a single ES module (`"module"`) or a single
    * file self contained script we executes in an immediately invoked function
    * when loaded (`"classic"`). */
  bundle?: "module" | "classic";
  /** If `true` then the sources will be typed checked, returning any
    * diagnostic errors in the result.  If `false` type checking will be
    * skipped.  Defaults to `true`.
    *
    * *Note* by default, only TypeScript will be type checked, just like on
    * the command line.  Use the `compilerOptions` options of `checkJs` to
    * enable type checking of JavaScript. */
  check?: boolean;
  /** A set of options that are aligned to TypeScript compiler options that
    * are supported by Deno. */
  compilerOptions?: CompilerOptions;
  /** An [import-map](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps#import-maps)
    * which will be applied to the imports. */
  importMap?: ImportMap;
  /** An absolute path to an [import-map](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps#import-maps).
    * Required to be specified if an `importMap` is specified to be able to
    * determine resolution of relative paths. If a `importMap` is not
    * specified, then it will assumed the file path points to an import map on
    * disk and will be attempted to be loaded based on current runtime
    * permissions.
    */
  importMapPath?: string;
  /** A record of sources to use when doing the emit.  If provided, Deno will
    * use these sources instead of trying to resolve the modules externally. */
  sources?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

The emit result is defined in the `Deno` namespace as:

```ts
interface EmitResult {
  /** Diagnostic messages returned from the type checker (`tsc`). */
  diagnostics: Diagnostic[];
  /** Any emitted files.  If bundled, then the JavaScript will have the
   * key of `deno:///bundle.js` with an optional map (based on
   * `compilerOptions`) in `deno:///bundle.js.map`. */
  files: Record<string, string>;
  /** An optional array of any compiler options that were ignored by Deno. */
  ignoredOptions?: string[];
  /** An array of internal statistics related to the emit, for diagnostic
   * purposes. */
  stats: Array<[string, number]>;
}
```

The API is designed to support several use cases, which are described in the
sections below.

### Using external sources

Using external sources, both local and remote, `Deno.emit()` can behave like
`deno cache` does on the command line, resolving those external dependencies,
type checking those dependencies, and providing an emitted output.

By default, `Deno.emit()` will utilise external resources. The _rootSpecifier_
supplied as the first argument will determine what module will be used as the
root. The root module is similar to what you would provide on the command line.

For example if you did:

```
> deno run mod.ts
```

You could do something similar with `Deno.emit()`:

```ts
try {
  const { files } = await Deno.emit("mod.ts");
  for (const [fileName, text] of Object.entries(files)) {
    console.log(`emitted ${fileName} with a length of ${text.length}`);
  }
} catch (e) {
  // something went wrong, inspect `e` to determine
}
```

`Deno.emit()` will use the same on disk cache for remote modules that the
standard CLI does, and it inherits the permissions and cache options of the
process that executes it.

If the _rootSpecifier_ is a relative path, then the current working directory of
the Deno process will be used to resolve the specifier. (Not relative to the
current module!)

The _rootSpecifier_ can be a string file path, a string URL, or a URL.
`Deno.emit()` supports the same protocols for URLs that Deno supports, which are
currently `file`, `http`, `https`, and `data`.

### Providing sources

Instead of resolving modules externally, you can provide `Deno.emit()` with the
sources directly. This is especially useful for a server to be able to provide
_on demand_ compiling of code supplied by a user, where the Deno process has
collected all the code it wants to emit.

The sources are passed in the _sources_ property of the `Deno.emit()` _options_
argument:

```ts
const { files } = await Deno.emit("/mod.ts", {
  sources: {
    "/mod.ts": `import * as a from "./a.ts";\nconsole.log(a);\n`,
    "/a.ts": `export const a: Record<string, string> = {};\n`,
  },
});
```

When sources are provided, Deno will no longer look externally and will try to
resolve all modules from within the map of sources provided, though the module
resolution follow the same rules as if the modules were external. For example
all module specifiers need their full filename. Also, because there are no media
types, if you are providing remote URLs in the sources, the path should end with
the appropriate extension, so that Deno can determine how to handle the file.

### Type checking and emitting

By default, `Deno.emit()` will type check any TypeScript (and TSX) it
encounters, just like on the command line. It will also attempt to transpile
JSX, but will leave JavaScript "alone". This behavior can be changed by changing
the compiler options. For example if you wanted Deno to type check your
JavaScript as well, you could set the _checkJs_ option to `true` in the compiler
options:

```ts
const { files, diagnostics } = await Deno.emit("./mod.js", {
  compilerOptions: {
    checkJs: true,
  },
});
```

The `Deno.emit()` result provides any diagnostic messages about the code
supplied. On the command line, any diagnostic messages get logged to stderr and
the Deno process terminates, but with `Deno.emit()` they are returned to the
caller.

Typically you will want to check if there are any diagnostics and handle them
appropriately. You can introspect the diagnostics individually, but there is a
handy formatting function available to make it easier to potentially log the
diagnostics to the console for the user called `Deno.formatDiagnostics()`:

```ts
const { files, diagnostics } = await Deno.emit("./mod.ts");
if (diagnostics.length) {
  // there is something that impacted the emit
  console.warn(Deno.formatDiagnostics(diagnostics));
}
```

### Bundling

`Deno.emit()` is also capable of providing output similar to `deno bundle` on
the command line. This is enabled by setting the _bundle_ option to `"module"`
or `"classic"`. Currently Deno supports bundling as a single file ES module
(`"module"`) or a single file self contained legacy script (`"classic"`).

```ts
const { files, diagnostics } = await Deno.emit("./mod.ts", {
  bundle: "module",
});
```

The _files_ of the result will contain a single key named `deno:///bundle.js` of
which the value with be the resulting bundle.

> ⚠️ Just like with `deno bundle`, the bundle will not include things like
> dynamic imports or worker scripts, and those would be expected to be resolved
> and available when the code is run.
### Import maps

`Deno.emit()` supports import maps as well, just like on the command line. This
is a really powerful feature that can be used even more effectively to emit and
bundle code.

Because of the way import maps work, when using with `Deno.emit()` you also have
to supply an absolute URL for the import map. This allows Deno to resolve any
relative URLs specified in the import map. This needs to be supplied even if the
import map doesn't contain any relative URLs. The URL does not need to really
exist, it is just feed to the API.

An example might be that I want to use a bare specifier to load a special
version of _lodash_ I am using with my project. I could do the following:

```ts
const { files } = await Deno.emit("mod.ts", {
  bundle: "module",
  importMap: {
    imports: {
      "lodash": "https://deno.land/x/lodash",
    },
  },
  importMapPath: "file:///import-map.json",
});
```

> ⚠️ If you are not bundling your code, the emitted code specifiers do not get
> rewritten, that means that whatever process will consume the code, Deno or a
> browser for example, would need to support import maps and have that map
> available at runtime.
### Skip type checking/transpiling only

`Deno.emit()` supports skipping type checking similar to the `--no-check` flag
on the command line. This is accomplished by setting the _check_ property to
`false`:

```ts
const { files } = await Deno.emit("./mod.ts", {
  check: false,
});
```

Setting _check_ to `false` will instruct Deno to not utilise the TypeScript
compiler to type check the code and emit it, instead only transpiling the code
from within Deno. This can be significantly quicker than doing the full type
checking.

### Compiler options

`Deno.emit()` supports quite a few compiler options that can impact how code is
type checked and emitted. They are similar to the options supported by a
`tsconfig.json` in the `compilerOptions` section, but there are several options
that are not supported. This is because they are either meaningless in Deno or
would cause Deno to not be able to work properly. The defaults for `Deno.emit()`
are the same defaults that are on the command line. The options are
[documented here](https://doc.deno.land/builtin/unstable#Deno.CompilerOptions)
along with their default values and are built into the Deno types.

If you are type checking your code, the compiler options will be type checked
for you, but if for some reason you are either dynamically providing the
compiler options or are not type checking, then the result of `Deno.emit()` will
provide you with an array of _ignoredOptions_ if there are any.

## Types and Type Declarations

One of the design principles of Deno is no non-standard module resolution. When
TypeScript is type checking a file, it only cares about the types for the file,
and the `tsc` compiler has a lot of logic to try to resolve those types. By
default, it expects _ambiguous_ module specifiers with an extension, and will
attempt to look for the file under the `.ts` specifier, then `.d.ts`, and
finally `.js` (plus a whole other set of logic when the module resolution is set
to `"node"`). Deno deals with explicit specifiers.

This can cause a couple problems though. For example, let's say I want to
consume a TypeScript file that has already been transpiled to JavaScript along
with a type definition file. So I have `mod.js` and `mod.d.ts`. If I try to
import `mod.js` into Deno, it will only do what I ask it to do, and import
`mod.js`, but that means my code won't be as well type checked as if TypeScript
was considering the `mod.d.ts` file in place of the `mod.js` file.

In order to support this in Deno, Deno has two solutions, of which there is a
variation of a solution to enhance support. The two main situations you come
across would be:

- As the importer of a JavaScript module, I know what types should be applied to
  the module.
- As the supplier of the JavaScript module, I know what types should be applied
  to the module.

The latter case is the better case, meaning you as the provider or host of the
module, everyone can consume it without having to figure out how to resolve the
types for the JavaScript module, but when consuming modules that you may not
have direct control over, the ability to do the former is also required.

### Providing types when importing

If you are consuming a JavaScript module and you have either created types (a
`.d.ts` file) or have otherwise obtained the types, you want to use, you can
instruct Deno to use that file when type checking instead of the JavaScript file
using the `@deno-types` compiler hint. `@deno-types` needs to be a single line
double slash comment, where when used impacts the next import or re-export
statement.

For example if I have a JavaScript modules `coolLib.js` and I had a separate
`coolLib.d.ts` file that I wanted to use, I would import it like this:

```ts
// @deno-types="./coolLib.d.ts"
import * as coolLib from "./coolLib.js";
```

When type checking `coolLib` and your usage of it in the file, the
`coolLib.d.ts` types will be used instead of looking at the JavaScript file.

The pattern matching for the compiler hint is somewhat forgiving and will accept
quoted and non-question values for the specifier as well as it accepts
whitespace before and after the equals sign.

### Providing types when hosting

If you are in control of the source code of the module, or you are in control of
how the file is hosted on a web server, there are two ways to inform Deno of the
types for a given module, without requiring the importer to do anything special.

#### Using the triple-slash reference directive

Deno supports using the triple-slash reference `types` directive, which adopts
the reference comment used by TypeScript in TypeScript files to _include_ other
files and applies it only to JavaScript files.

For example, if I had created `coolLib.js` and along side of it I had created my
type definitions for my library in `coolLib.d.ts` I could do the following in
the `coolLib.js` file:

```js
/// <reference types="./coolLib.d.ts" />
// ... the rest of the JavaScript ...
```

When Deno encounters this directive, it would resolve the `./coolLib.d.ts` file
and use that instead of the JavaScript file when TypeScript was type checking
the file, but still load the JavaScript file when running the program.

> ℹ️ _Note_ this is a repurposed directive for TypeScript that only applies to
> JavaScript files. Using the triple-slash reference directive of `types` in a
> TypeScript file works under Deno as well, but has essentially the same
> behavior as the `path` directive.
#### Using X-TypeScript-Types header

Similar to the triple-slash directive, Deno supports a header for remote modules
that instructs Deno where to locate the types for a given module. For example, a
response for `https://example.com/coolLib.js` might look something like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 648
X-TypeScript-Types: ./coolLib.d.ts
```

When seeing this header, Deno would attempt to retrieve
`https://example.com/coolLib.d.ts` and use that when type checking the original
module.

### Using ambient or global types

Overall it is better to use module/UMD type definitions with Deno, where a
module expressly imports the types it depends upon. Modular type definitions can
express
[augmentation of the global scope](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/global-modifying-module-d-ts.html)
via the `declare global` in the type definition. For example:

```ts
declare global {
  var AGlobalString: string;
}
```

This would make `AGlobalString` available in the global namespace when importing
the type definition.

In some cases though, when leveraging other existing type libraries, it may not
be possible to leverage modular type definitions. Therefore there are ways to
include arbitrary type definitions when type checking programmes.

#### Using a triple-slash directive

This option couples the type definitions to the code itself. By adding a
triple-slash `types` directive near the type of a module, type checking the file
will include the type definition. For example:

```ts
/// <reference types="./types.d.ts" />
```

The specifier provided is resolved just like any other specifier in Deno, which
means it requires an extension, and is relative to the module referencing it. It
can be a fully qualified URL as well:

```ts
/// <reference types="https://deno.land/x/pkg@1.0.0/types.d.ts" />
```

#### Using a `tsconfig.json` file

Another option is to use a `tsconfig.json` file that is configured to include
the type definitions, by supplying a `"types"` value to the `"compilerOptions"`.
For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": [
      "./types.d.ts",
      "https://deno.land/x/pkg@1.0.0/types.d.ts",
      "/Users/me/pkg/types.d.ts"
    ]
  }
}
```

Like the triple-slash reference above, the specifier supplied in the `"types"`
array will be resolved like other specifiers in Deno. In the case of relative
specifiers, it will be resolved relative to the path to the `tsconfig.json`.

### Type Checking Web Workers

When Deno loads a TypeScript module in a web worker, it will automatically type
check the module and its dependencies against the Deno web worker library. This
can present a challenge in other contexts like `deno cache`, `deno bundle`, or
in editors. There are a couple of ways to instruct Deno to use the worker
libraries instead of the standard Deno libraries.

#### Using triple-slash directives

This option couples the library settings with the code itself. By adding the
following triple-slash directives near the top of the entry point file for the
worker script, Deno will now type check it as a Deno worker script, irrespective
of how the module is analyzed:

```ts
/// <reference no-default-lib="true" />
/// <reference lib="deno.worker" />
```

The first directive ensures that no other default libraries are used. If this is
omitted, you will get some conflicting type definitions, because Deno will try
to apply the standard Deno library as well. The second instructs Deno to apply
the built in Deno worker type definitions plus dependent libraries (like
`"esnext"`).

When you run a `deno cache` or `deno bundle` command or use an IDE which uses
the Deno language server, Deno should automatically detect these directives and
apply the correct libraries when type checking.

The one disadvantage of this, is that it makes the code less portable to other
non-Deno platforms like `tsc`, as it is only Deno which has the `"deno.worker"`
library built into it.

#### Using a `tsconfig.json` file

Another option is to use a `tsconfig.json` file that is configured to apply the
library files. A minimal file that would work would look something like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "lib": ["deno.worker"]
  }
}
```

Then when running a command on the command line, you would need to pass the
`--config tsconfig.json` argument, or if you are using an IDE which leverages
the Deno language server, set the `deno.config` setting.

If you also have non-worker scripts, you will either need to omit the `--config`
argument, or have one that is configured to meet the needs of your non-worker
scripts.

### Important points

#### Type declaration semantics

Type declaration files (`.d.ts` files) follow the same semantics as other files
in Deno. This means that declaration files are assumed to be module declarations
(_UMD declarations_) and not ambient/global declarations. It is unpredictable
how Deno will handle ambient/global declarations.

In addition, if a type declaration imports something else, like another `.d.ts`
file, its resolution follow the normal import rules of Deno. For a lot of the
`.d.ts` files that are generated and available on the web, they may not be
compatible with Deno.

To overcome this problem, some solution providers, like the
[Skypack CDN](https://www.skypack.dev/), will automatically bundle type
declarations just like they provide bundles of JavaScript as ESM.

#### Deno Friendly CDNs

There are CDNs which host JavaScript modules that integrate well with Deno.

- [Skypack.dev](https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/code/deno) is a CDN which
  provides type declarations (via the `X-TypeScript-Types` header) when you
  append `?dts` as a query string to your remote module import statements. For
  example:

  ```ts
  import React from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/react?dts";
  ```

### Behavior of JavaScript when type checking

If you import JavaScript into TypeScript in Deno and there are no types, even if
you have `checkJs` set to `false` (the default for Deno), the TypeScript
compiler will still access the JavaScript module and attempt to do some static
analysis on it, to at least try to determine the shape of the exports of that
module to validate the import in the TypeScript file.

This is usually never a problem when trying to import a "regular" ES module, but
in some cases if the module has special packaging, or is a global _UMD_ module,
TypeScript's analysis of the module can fail and cause misleading errors. The
best thing to do in this situation is provide some form of types using one of
the methods mention above.

#### Internals

While it isn't required to understand how Deno works internally to be able to
leverage TypeScript with Deno well, it can help to understand how it works.

Before any code is executed or compiled, Deno generates a module graph by
parsing the root module, and then detecting all of its dependencies, and then
retrieving and parsing those modules, recursively, until all the dependencies
are retrieved.

For each dependency, there are two potential "slots" that are used. There is the
code slot and the type slot. As the module graph is filled out, if the module is
something that is or can be emitted to JavaScript, it fills the code slot, and
type only dependencies, like `.d.ts` files fill the type slot.

When the module graph is built, and there is a need to type check the graph,
Deno starts up the TypeScript compiler and feeds it the names of the modules
that need to be potentially emitted as JavaScript. During that process, the
TypeScript compiler will request additional modules, and Deno will look at the
slots for the dependency, offering it the type slot if it is filled before
offering it the code slot.
This means when you import a `.d.ts` module, or you use one of the solutions
above to provide alternative type modules for JavaScript code, that is what is
provided to TypeScript instead when resolving the module.

+## Windows
+
+This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:
+
+1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
+2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
+3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
+4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could possibly cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
+    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
+    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

+The github.dev web-based editor is a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. You can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes.
+
+
+There are two ways to go directly to a VS Code environment in your browser and start coding:
+
+
+* Press the . key on any repository or pull request.
+
+* Swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL. For example, this repo https://github.com/github/dev becomes http://github.dev/github/dev
+
+
+Preview the gif below to get a quick demo of github.dev in action.

+
+
+# Why?
+
+It’s a quick way to edit and navigate code. It's especially useful if you want to edit multiple files at a time or take advantage of all the powerful code editing features of Visual Studio Code when making a quick change. For more information, see our [documentation](https://github.co/codespaces-editor-help).

+# Telegram iOS Source Code Compilation Guide
+
+We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
+There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
+
+# Creating your Telegram Application
+
+1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
+2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
+3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
+3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
+4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
+
+# Compilation Guide
+
+1. Install Xcode (directly from https://developer.apple.com/download/more or using the App Store).
+2. Clone the project from GitHub:
+
+```
+git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS.git
+```
+
+3. Adjust configuration parameters
+
+```
+mkdir -p $HOME/telegram-configuration
+cp -R build-system/example-configuration/* $HOME/telegram-configuration/
+```
+
+- Modify the values in `variables.bzl`
+- Replace the provisioning profiles in `provisioning` with valid files
+
+4. (Optional) Create a build cache directory to speed up rebuilds
+
+```
+mkdir -p "$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache"
+```
+
+5. Build the app
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
+    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+    build \
+    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+    --buildNumber=100001 \
+    --configuration=release_universal
+```
+
+6. (Optional) Generate an Xcode project
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
+    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+    generateProject \
+    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+    --disableExtensions
+```
+
+It is possible to generate a project that does not require any codesigning certificates to be installed: add `--disableProvisioningProfiles` flag:
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
+    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+    generateProject \
+    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+    --disableExtensions \
+    --disableProvisioningProfiles
+```
+
+
+Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.
+
+
+# Tips
+
+Bazel is used to build the app. To simplify the development setup a helper script is provided (`build-system/Make/Make.py`). See help:
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --help
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py build --help
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py generateProject --help
+```
+
+Bazel is automatically downloaded when running Make.py for the first time. If you wish to use your own build of Bazel, pass `--bazel=path-to-bazel`. If your Bazel version differs from that in `versions.json`, you may use `--overrideBazelVersion` to skip the version check.
+
+Each release is built using specific Xcode and Bazel versions (see `versions.json`). The helper script checks the versions of installed software and reports an error if they don't match the ones specified in `versions.json`. There are flags that allow to bypass these checks:
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideBazelVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Bazel
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideXcodeVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Xcode
+```

 # Telegram iOS Source Code Compilation Guide

+
+
 We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
+
 There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.

+
+
 # Creating your Telegram Application

+
+
 1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
+
+
 2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
+
 3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
+
 3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
+
 4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.

+
+
 # Compilation Guide

+
+
 1. Install Xcode (directly from https://developer.apple.com/download/more or using the App Store).
+
 2. Clone the project from GitHub:

+
+
 ```
+
 git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS.git
+
 ```

+
+
 3. Adjust configuration parameters

+
+
 ```
+
 mkdir -p $HOME/telegram-configuration
+
 cp -R build-system/example-configuration/* $HOME/telegram-configuration/
+
 ```

+
+
 - Modify the values in `variables.bzl`
+
 - Replace the provisioning profiles in `provisioning` with valid files

+
+
 4. (Optional) Create a build cache directory to speed up rebuilds

+
+
 ```
+
 mkdir -p "$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache"
+
 ```

+
+
 5. Build the app

+
+
 ```
+
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
-    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
-    build \
-    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
-    --buildNumber=100001 \
-    --configuration=release_universal
+
+--cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+
+build \
+
+--configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+
+--buildNumber=100001 \
+
+--configuration=release_universal
+
 ```

+
+
 6. (Optional) Generate an Xcode project

+
+
 ```
+
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
-    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
-    generateProject \
-    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
-    --disableExtensions
+
+--cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+
+generateProject \
+
+--configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+
+--disableExtensions
+
 ```

+
+
 It is possible to generate a project that does not require any codesigning certificates to be installed: add `--disableProvisioningProfiles` flag:
+
+
 ```
+
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
-    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
-    generateProject \
-    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
-    --disableExtensions \
-    --disableProvisioningProfiles
-```

+--cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \

-Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.
+generateProject \

+--configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \

+Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.
 # Tips
-
 Bazel is used to build the app. To simplify the development setup a helper script is provided (`build-system/Make/Make.py`). See help:
-
-```
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --help
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py build --help
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py generateProject --help
-```
+Bazel is automatically downloaded when running Make.py for the first time. If you wish to use your own build of Bazel, pass `--bazel=path-to-bazel`. If your Bazel version differs from 
+that in `versions.json`, you may use `--overrideBazelVersion` to skip the version check.
+Each release is built using specific Xcode and Bazel versions (see `versions.json`). The helper script checks the versions of installed software and reports an error if they don't match 
+the ones specified in `versions.json`. There are flags that allow to bypass these checks:
+Python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideBazelVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Bazel
+Python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideXcodeVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Xcode

+U.S. Treasury Check Security Features
+Ultraviolet Overprinting Pattern
+A protective ultraviolet pattern, invisible to the
+naked eye, consisting of four lines of “FMS” or
+"FISCALSERVICE” bracketed by the “Fiscal
+Service” or “Financial Management Service”
+seal on the left and United States Seal (eagle)
+on the right. This pattern can usually be found
+under the payee information and dollar amount
+area. The FISCAL SERVICE pattern and seals
+can be detected under a black light. If the
+amount box is shaved or altered in any way, a
+space will be created in the ultraviolet area.
+When exposed to black light, the ink used in
+the pattern and the seal will glow. This
+fluorescent quality cannot be photocopied.
+Treasury Seal
+The seal identifies the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” or
+"Financial Management Service." The previous seal
+reflecting “Financial Management Service” will be seen
+in rotation until this check stock runs out.
+Bleeding Ink
+The Treasury seal, located to the right of the Statue of
+Liberty, contains security ink that will run and turn red
+when moisture is applied to the black ink of the seal.
+Microprinting
+Microprinted words are so small they appear as just a
+line to the naked eye. However, when magnified, they
+become visible. Microprinting cannot be duplicated by a
+copier and when a check is counterfeited, it will often
+show up as a solid line or a series of dots. The U.S.
+Treasury check has three areas where microprinting is
+used.
+Watermark
+All U.S. Treasury checks are printed on
+watermarked paper. The watermark
+reads “U.S. TREASURY” and can be
+seen from both the front and back of the
+check when held up to a light. The
+watermark is light and cannot be
+reproduced by a copier. Any check not
+having the watermark should be
+suspected as being counterfeit or copied.
+You may verify check issue information using the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Treasury Check Verification System (TCVS) at: https://tcvs.fiscal.treasury.gov
